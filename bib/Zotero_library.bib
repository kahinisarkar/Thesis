  abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors have emerged as important regulators of mammalian and Drosophila adult physiology, affecting such seemingly diverse processes as adipogenesis, carbohydrate metabolism, circadian rhythm, stem cell function, and gamete production. Although nuclear hormone receptors Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (Usp) have multiple known roles in Drosophila development and regulate key processes during oogenesis, the adult function of the majority of nuclear hormone receptors remains largely undescribed. Ecdysone-induced protein 78C (E78), a nuclear hormone receptor closely related to Drosophila E75 and to mammalian Rev-Erb and Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors, was originally identified as an early ecdysone target; however, it has remained unclear whether E78 significantly contributes to adult physiology or reproductive function. To further explore the biological function of E78 in oogenesis, we used available E78 reporters and created a new E78 loss-of-function allele. We found that E78 is expressed throughout the germline during oogenesis, and is important for proper egg production and for the maternal control of early embryogenesis. We showed that E78 is required during development to establish the somatic germline stem cell (GSC) niche, and that E78 function in the germline promotes the survival of developing follicles. Consistent with its initial discovery as an ecdysone-induced target, we also found significant genetic interactions between E78 and components of the ecdysone-signaling pathway. Taken together with the previously described roles of EcR, Usp, and E75, our results suggest that nuclear hormone receptors are critical for the broad transcriptional control of a wide variety of cellular processes during oogenesis.},

The spatio-temporal distribution of embryonic RA results from regulated expression of RA-synthesizing retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and RA-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (CYP26). Excess RA administration or RA deficiency results in a complex spectrum of embryonic abnormalities. As a first step in understanding the developmental function of RA-metabolizing enzymes, we have disrupted the murine Cyp26A1 gene. We report that Cyp26A1-null mutants die during mid-late gestation and show a number of major morphogenetic defects. Spina bifida and truncation of the tail and lumbosacral region (including abnormalities of the kidneys, urogenital tract, and hindgut) are the most conspicuous defects, leading in extreme cases to a sirenomelia ("mermaid tail") phenotype. Cyp26A1 mutants also show posterior transformations of cervical vertebrae and abnormal patterning of the rostral hindbrain, which appears to be partially posteriorly transformed. These defects correlate with two major sites of Cyp26A1 expression in the rostral neural plate and embryonic tail bud. Because all of the Cyp26A1-/- abnormalities closely resemble RA teratogenic effects, we postulate that the key function of CYP26A1 is to maintain specific embryonic areas in a RA-depleted state, to protect them against the deleterious effect of ectopic RA signaling.},

To date, no DNA sequence has been discovered to explain the specificity of MSL binding. We hypothesized that sequence-specific targeting occurs at "chromatin entry sites," but the majority of sites are sequence independent. Here we characterize 150 potential entry sites by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq and discover a GA-rich MSL recognition element (MRE). The motif is only slightly enriched on the X chromosome ({$\sim$}2-fold), but this is doubled when considering its preferential location within or 3{${'}$} to active genes (\textbackslash textgreater4-fold enrichment). When inserted on an autosome, a newly identified site can direct local MSL spreading to flanking active genes. These results provide strong evidence for both sequence-dependent and -independent steps in MSL targeting of dosage compensation to the male X chromosome. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The Drosophila MSL complex mediates dosage compensation by increasing transcription of the single X chromosome in males approximately two-fold. This is accomplished through recognition of the X chromosome and subsequent acetylation of histone H4K16 on X-linked genes. Initial binding to the X is thought to occur at "entry sites" that contain a consensus sequence motif ("MSL recognition element" or MRE). However, this motif is only {$\sim$}2 fold enriched on X, and only a fraction of the motifs on X are initially targeted. Here we ask whether chromatin context could distinguish between utilized and non-utilized copies of the motif, by comparing their relative enrichment for histone modifications and chromosomal proteins mapped in the modENCODE project. Through a comparative analysis of the chromatin features in male S2 cells (which contain MSL complex) and female Kc cells (which lack the complex), we find that the presence of active chromatin modifications, together with an elevated local GC content in the surrounding sequences, has strong predictive value for functional MSL entry sites, independent of MSL binding. We tested these sites for function in Kc cells by RNAi knockdown of Sxl, resulting in induction of MSL complex. We show that ectopic MSL expression in Kc cells leads to H4K16 acetylation around these sites and a relative increase in X chromosome transcription. Collectively, our results support a model in which a pre-existing active chromatin environment, coincident with H3K36me3, contributes to MSL entry site selection. The consequences of MSL targeting of the male X chromosome include increase in nucleosome lability, enrichment for H4K16 acetylation and JIL-1 kinase, and depletion of linker histone H1 on active X-linked genes. Our analysis can serve as a model for identifying chromatin and local sequence features that may contribute to selection of functional protein binding sites in the genome. \textcopyright{} 2012 Alekseyenko et al.}

We found that the Caenorhabditis elegans histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylases RBR-2 and SPR-5 promoted postmitotic longevity of stress-resistant daf-2 adults, altered pools of methylated H3K4, and promoted silencing of some daf-2 target genes. In addition, RBR-2 and SPR-5 were required for germ cell immortality at a high temperature. Transgenerational proliferative aging was enhanced for spr-5; rbr-2 double mutants, suggesting that these histone demethylases may function sequentially to promote germ cell immortality by targeting distinct H3K4 methyl marks. RBR-2 did not play a comparable role in the maintenance of quiescent germ cells in dauer larvae, implying that it represses stress that occurs as a consequence of germ cell proliferation, rather than stress that accumulates in nondividing cells. We propose that H3K4 demethylase activities promote the maintenance of chromatin states during stressful growth conditions, thereby repressing postmitotic aging of somatic cells as well as proliferative aging of germ cells. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

  abstract = {During gametogenesis and pre-implantation development, the mammalian epigenome is reprogrammed to establish pluripotency in the epiblast. Here we show that the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, MLL2, controls most of the promoter-specific chromatin modification, H3K4me3, during oogenesis and early development. Using conditional knockout mutagenesis and a hypomorph model, we show that Mll2 deficiency in oocytes results in anovulation and oocyte death, with increased transcription of p53, apoptotic factors, and Iap elements. MLL2 is required for (1) bulk H3K4me3 but not H3K4me1, indicating that MLL2 controls most promoters but monomethylation is regulated by a different H3K4 methyltransferase; (2) the global transcriptional silencing that preceeds resumption of meiosis but not for the concomitant nuclear reorganization into the surrounded nucleolus (SN) chromatin configuration; (3) oocyte survival; and (4) normal zygotic genome activation. These results reveal that MLL2 is autonomously required in oocytes for fertility and imply that MLL2 contributes to the epigenetic reprogramming that takes place before fertilization. We propose that once this task has been accomplished, MLL2 is not required until gastrulation and that other methyltransferases are responsible for bulk H3K4me3, thereby revealing an unexpected epigenetic control switch amongst the H3K4 methyltransferases during development. \textcopyright{} 2010 Andreu-Vieyra et al.}

  abstract = {Vitamin A (retinol) regulates embryonic development and adult epithelial function via metabolism to retinoic acid, a pleiotrophic regulator of gene expression. Retinoic acid is synthesized locally and functions in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, but the enzymes involved remain obscure. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isozymes capable of metabolizing retinol include class I and class IV ADHs, with class III ADH unable to perform this function. ADHs also metabolize ethanol, and high levels of ethanol inhibit retinol metabolism, suggesting a possible mode of action for some of the medical complications of alcoholism. To explore whether any ADH isozymes are linked to retinoic acid synthesis, herein we have examined the expression patterns of all known classes of ADH in mouse embryonic and adult tissues, and also measured retinoic acid levels. Using in situ hybridization, class I ADH mRNA was localized in the embryo to the epithelia of the genitourinary tract, intestinal tract, adrenal gland, liver, conjunctival sac, epidermis, nasal epithelium, and lung, plus in the adult to epithelia within the testis, epididymis, uterus, kidney, intestine, adrenal cortex, and liver. Class IV ADH mRNA was localized in the embryo to the adrenal gland and nasal epithelium, plus in the adult to the epithelia of the esophagus, stomach, testis, epididymis, epidermis, and adrenal cortex. Class III ADH mRNA, in contrast, was present at low levels and not highly localized in the embryonic and adult tissues examined. We detected significant retinoic acid levels in the fetal kidney, fetal/adult intestine and adrenal gland, as well as the adult liver, lung, testis, epididymis, and uterus-all sites of class I and/or class IV ADH gene expression. These findings indicate that the expression patterns of class I ADH and class IV ADH, but not class III ADH, are consistent with a function in local retinoic acid synthesis needed for the development and maintenance of many specialized epithelial tissues.},

Some members of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family catalyze retinol oxidation, the rate-limiting step in RA synthesis. Here we have examined mouse embryos for the presence of endogenous RA and expression of ADH genes. RA was not detected in egg cylinder stage embryos but was detected in late primitive streak stage embryos. Detection of class IV ADH mRNA, but not class I or class III, coincided with the onset of RA synthesis, being absent in egg cylinder embryos but present in the posterior mesoderm of late primitive streak embryos. During neurulation, RA and class IV ADH mRNA were colocalized in the craniofacial region, trunk, and forelimb bud. Class IV ADH mRNA was detected in cranial neural crest cells and craniofacial mesenchyme as well as trunk and forelimb bud mesenchyme. The spatiotemporal expression pattern and enzymatic properties of class IV ADH are thus consistent with a crucial function in RA synthesis during embryogenesis. In addition, the finding of endogenous RA and class IV ADH mRNA in the craniofacial region has implications for the mechanism of fetal alcohol syndrome.}

  abstract = {SET domains are protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate diverse proteins, such as, histones, Rubisco and cytochrome C. In particular, they play an important role in the dynamics of the eukaryotic chromatin and are present in several chromatin-associated proteins. Recently, structures of several SET domains have been solved, and they contain a conserved fold that is unrelated to previously characterized methyltransferases, which possess either Rossmann fold or SPOUT domains. Phylogenetic and phyletic-profile analysis of the SET domain suggests that it was an evolutionary "invention" of the eukaryotic lineage, with secondary lateral transfers to bacteria. We show that the conserved N- and C- terminal regions, which comprise the core barrel-like module of the SET domain, are symmetric repeats of a simple 3-stranded unit. Furthermore, the two symmetrically arranged repeats contribute to the binding sites for the two substrates of the SET domain. This suggests the SET domain arose from an ancestral dimer of this 3-stranded unit, with each unit probably functioning as generic-ligand binding structure. The divergence between the two repeat units appears to have arisen as a result of their interactions with the central module of the SET domain, which was inserted between the two repeats. One of the repeats appears to have acquired adaptations, which helped it to specialize in AdoMet binding, whereas the second repeat contributed to histone-interaction, and in orienting a crucial active site residue. The central module of the SET domain supplies a critical asparagine to the active site, and its structural features suggest that it may have also arisen from a further duplication of one of the repeats comprising the core barrel. However, it appears to have structurally diverged from the two canonical repeats due to the lack of an obligate dimerization partner. The spatial position of the two repeats in the ancestral dimer appears to have favored the formation of the structural knot typical of the SET domain. A comparable knot is seen in the SPOUT-domain methyltransferases, and this represents a case of convergent evolution of an active-site-associated configuration in two otherwise unrelated classes of methylases. Thus, the SET domain provides a model for the innovation of a complex enzymatic fold through the duplications of a structurally simple non-enzymatic unit.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic chromosomal components, especially histones, are subject to a wide array of covalent modifications and catalytic reorganization. These modifications have an important role in the regulation of chromatin structure and are mediated by large multisubunit complexes that contain modular proteins with several conserved catalytic and noncatalytic adaptor domains. RESULTS: Using computational sequence-profile analysis methods, we identified a previously uncharacterized, predicted alpha-helical domain of about 85 residues in chromosomal proteins such as Swi3p, Rsc8p, Moira and several other uncharacterized proteins. This module, termed the SWIRM domain, is predicted to mediate specific protein-protein interactions in the assembly of chromatin-protein complexes. In one group of proteins, which are highly conserved throughout the crown-group eukaryotes, the SWIRM domain is linked to a catalytic domain related to the monoamine and polyamine oxidases. Another human protein has the SWIRM domain linked to a JAB domain that is involved in protein degradation through the ubiquitin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the SWIRM domain could help in directed experimental analysis of specific interactions in chromosomal proteins. We predict that the proteins in which it is combined with an amino-oxidase domain define a novel class of chromatin-modifying enzymes, which are likely to oxidize either the amino group of basic residues in histones and other chromosomal proteins or the polyamines in chromatin, and thereby alter the charge distribution. Other forms, such as KIAA1915, may link chromatin modification to ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.},

  abstract = {The transcription of nucleus-encoded genes in eukaryotes is performed by three distinct RNA polymerases termed I, II, and III, each of which is a complex enzyme composed of more than 10 subunits. The isolation of genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic RNA polymerases from a wide spectrum of organisms has confirmed previous biochemical and immunological data indicating that all three enzymes are closely related in structures that have been conserved in evolution. Each RNA polymerase is an enzyme complex composed of two large subunits that are homologous to the two largest subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerases and are associated with smaller polypeptides, some of which are common to two or to all three eukaryotic enzymes. This remarkable conservation of structure most probably underlies a conservation of function and emphasizes the likelihood that information gained from the study of RNA polymerases from one organism will be applicable to others. The recent isolation of many mutations affecting the structure and/or function of eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA polymerases now makes it feasible to begin integrating genetic and biochemical information from various species in order to develop a picture of these enzymes. The picture of eukaryotic RNA polymerases depicted in this article emphasizes the role(s) of different polypeptide regions in interaction with other subunits, cofactors, substrates, inhibitors, or accessory transcription factors, as well as the requirement for these interactions in transcription initiation, elongation, pausing, termination, and/or enzyme assembly. Most mutations described here have been isolated in eukaryotic organisms that have well- developed experimental genetic systems as well as amenable biochemistry, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. When relevant, mutations affecting regions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase that are conserved among eukaryotes and prokaryotes are also presented. In addition to providing information about the structure and function of eukaryotic RNA polymerases, the study of mutations and of the pleiotropic phenotypes they imposed has underscored the central role played by these enzymes in many fundamental processes such as development and cellular differentiation.},

  abstract = {A fundamental yet unexplored question in stem cell biology is how the fate of tissue stem cells is initially determined during development. In Drosophila, germline stem cells (GSCs) descend from a subset of primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the onset of oogenesis. GSC determination may occur at the onset of oogenesis when a subset of PGCs is induced to become GSCs by contacting niche cells. Alternatively, the GSC fate could be predetermined for a subset of PGCs before oogenesis, due to either their interaction with specific somatic cells in the embryonic/larval gonads, or their inherently heterogeneous potential in becoming GSCs, or both. Here, we show that anterior somatic cells in the embryonic gonad already differ from posterior somatic cells and are likely to be the precursors of niche cells in the adult ovary. Furthermore, only pole cells in the anterior half of the embryonic gonad give rise to the PGCs that frequently acquire contact with nascent niche cells in the late larval ovary. Eventually, only these contacting PGCs become GSCs, whereas non-contacting PGCs directly differentiate into cystoblasts. The strong preference of these 'anterior PGCs' towards contacting niche cells does not require DE-cadherin-mediated adhesion and is not correlated with either orientation or rate of their divisions. These data suggest that the GSC fate is predetermined before oogenesis. The predetermination probably involves soma/pole-cell interaction in the anterior half of the embryonic gonad, followed by an active homing mechanism during PGC proliferation to maintain the contact between the 'anterior PGCs' and anterior somatic cells.},

Studies in the last few decades have revealed the significance of histone PTMs in key cellular processes including DNA replication, repair, transcription, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. The PTMs on histones are carried out by chromatin modifiers, which are reversible in nature. The dynamic activity of chromatin modifiers maintains the levels of different PTMs on histones. The modified histones are recognized by reader proteins, which recruit effector proteins to regulate the function. The interplay between histone PTMs and chromatin dynamics plays a major role in the regulation of most of the cellular processes. Importantly, the perturbations in the histone PTMs by various intrinsic or extrinsic factors can cause defects in fundamental cellular processes leading to a wide range of diseases. The proteolytic clipping of histone proteins has also been shown to regulate many biological processes. Histone clipping has been observed from yeast to mammals, suggesting that this mechanism is a conserved epigenetic phenomenon. In this review, we have summarized the significance of histone clipping and provided future directions to comprehend the mechanism of this distinct and poorly understood epigenetic event.},

Most MPN patients have a point mutation in JAK2 (JAK2V617F), which encodes a dominant-active kinase that constitutively triggers JAK/STAT signaling. In Drosophila, this pathway is simplified, with a single JAK, Hopscotch (Hop), and a single STAT transcription factor, Stat92E. The hopTumorous-lethal [hopTum] allele encodes a dominantactive kinase that induces sustained Stat92E activation. Like MPN patients, hopTum mutants have significantly more myeloid cells, which form invasive tumors. Through an unbiased genetic screen, we found that heterozygosity for Enhancer of Polycomb [E(Pc)], a component of the Tip60 lysine acetyltransferase complex (also known as KAT5 in humans), significantly increased tumor burden in hopTum animals. Hematopoietic depletion of E(Pc) or other Tip60 components in an otherwise wild-type background also induced blood cell tumors. The E(Pc) tumor phenotype was dependent on JAK/STAT activity, as concomitant depletion of hop or Stat92E inhibited tumor formation. Stat92E target genes were significantly upregulated in E(Pc)-mutant myeloid cells, indicating that loss of E(Pc) activates JAK/STAT signaling. Neither the hop nor Stat92E gene was upregulated upon hematopoietic E(Pc) depletion, suggesting that the regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway by E(Pc) is dependent on substrates other than histones. Indeed, E(Pc) depletion significantly increased expression of Hop protein in myeloid cells. This study indicates that E(Pc) works as a tumor suppressor by attenuating Hop protein expression and ultimately JAK/STAT signaling. Since loss-of-function mutations in the human homologs of E(Pc) and Tip60 are frequently observed in cancer, our work could lead to new treatments for MPN patients.},

To test this model, we studied 125 human muscle biopsies from 13 diagnostic groups (125 U133A, 125 U133B microarrays), including EDMD patients with LMNA and emerin mutations. A Visual and Statistical Data Analyzer (VISDA) algorithm was used to statistically model cluster hierarchy, resulting in a tree of phenotypic classifications. Validations of the diagnostic tree included permutations of U133A and U133B arrays, and use of two probe set algorithms (MAS5.0 and MBE1). This showed that the two nuclear envelope defects (EDMD LMNA, EDMD emerin) were highly related disorders and were also related to fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD has recently been hypothesized to involve abnormal interactions of chromatin with the nuclear envelope. To identify disease-specific transcripts for EDMD, we applied a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approach using LMNA patient muscle as a test data set, with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validations in both LMNA and emerin patient muscle. A high proportion of top-ranked and validated transcripts were components of the same transcriptional regulatory pathway involving Rb1 and MyoD during muscle regeneration (CRI-1, CREBBP, NapIL1, ECREBBP/p300), where each was specifically upregulated in EDMD. Using a muscle regeneration time series (27 time points) we develop a transcriptional model for downstream consequences of LMNA and emerin mutations. We propose that key interactions between the nuclear envelope and Rb and MyoD fail in EDMD at the point of myoblast exit from the cell cycle, leading to poorly coordinated phosphorylation and acetylation steps. Our data is consistent with mutations of nuclear lamina components leading to destabilization of the transcriptome in differentiated cells. \textcopyright{} The Author (2006).

  abstract = {Throughout the last decade, great advances have been made in our understanding of how DNA-templated cellular processes occur in the native chromatin environment. Proteins that regulate transcription, replication, DNA repair, mitosis and other processes must be targeted to specific regions of the genome and granted access to DNA, which is normally tightly packaged in the higher-order chromatin structure of eukaryotic nuclei. Massive multiprotein complexes have been discovered, which facilitate access to DNA and recruitment of downstream effectors through three distinct mechanisms: chemical modification of histone amino-acid residues, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone exchange. The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase (SAGA) transcriptional co-activator complex regulates numerous cellular processes through coordination of multiple histone post-translational modifications. SAGA is known to generate and interact with a number of histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation and phosphorylation. Although best characterized for its role in regulating transcriptional activation, SAGA is also required for optimal transcription elongation, mRNA export and perhaps nucleotide excision repair. Here, we discuss findings from recent years that have elucidated the function of this 1.8-MDa complex in multiple cellular processes, and how misregulation of the homologous complexes in humans may ultimately play a role in development of disease. \textcopyright{} 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

Here we show that ATM is held inactive in unirradiated cells as a dimer or higher-order multimer, with the kinase domain bound to a region surrounding serine 1981 that is contained within the previously described 'FAT' domain. Cellular irradiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 that causes dimer dissociation and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Most ATM molecules in the cell are rapidly phosphorylated on this site after doses of radiation as low as 0.5 Gy, and binding of a phosphospecific antibody is detectable after the introduction of only a few DNA doublestrand breaks in the cell. Activation of the ATM kinase seems to be an initiating event in cellular responses to irradiation, and our data indicate that ATM activation is not dependent on direct binding to DNA strand breaks, but may result from changes in the structure of chromatin.},

The chromo domain of HP1 is necessary for both targeting and transcriptional repression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the correct localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) depends on Clr4, a homologue of the mammalian SUV39H1 histone methylase. Both Clr4 and SUV39H1 methylate specifically lysine 9 of histone H3 (ref. 6). Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4. The chromo domain of HP1 is identified as its methyl-lysine-binding domain. A point mutation in the chromo domain, which destroys the gene silencing activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolishes methyl-lysine-binding activity. Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe shows that the methylase activity of Clr4 is necessary for the correct localization of Swi6 at centromeric heterochromatin and for gene silencing. These results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a 'methyl marker' on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromo domain. This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the heterochromatic state.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replacement of H4K91 by glutamate that mimics Kglu influences chromatin structure and thereby results in a global upregulation of transcription and defects in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and telomere silencing. In mammalian cells, H4K91glu is mainly enriched at promoter regions of highly expressed genes. A downregulation of H4K91glu is tightly associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis and in response to DNA damage. The cellular dynamics of H4K91glu is controlled by Sirt7 as a deglutarylase and KAT2A as a glutaryltransferase. This study designates a new histone mark (Kglu) as a new regulatory mechanism for chromatin dynamics.},

We reassessed the role of SAGA by mapping its genome-wide location and role in global transcription in budding yeast. We find that SAGA maps to the UAS elements of most genes, overlapping with Mediator binding and irrespective of previous designations of SAGA- or TFIID-dominated genes. Disruption of SAGA through mutation or rapid subunit depletion reduces transcription from nearly all genes, measured by newly synthesized RNA. We also find that the acetyltransferase Gcn5 synergizes with Spt3 to promote global transcription and that Spt3 functions to stimulate TBP recruitment at all tested genes. Our data demonstrate that SAGA acts as a general cofactor required for essentially all RNA polymerase II transcription and is not consistent with the previous classification of SAGA- and TFIID-dominated genes. Baptista et al. show that SAGA, a transcriptional coactivator conserved in all eukaryotes, is involved in overall RNA polymerase II transcription in budding yeast. Using ChEC-seq, SAGA was shown to be recruited to both TATA-containing and TATA-less genes. In agreement, inactivation of SAGA leads to dramatic effects on nascent transcription.},

Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in Emu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc-overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap-dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous IRES-dependent form of Cdk11 (also known as Cdc2l and PITSLRE), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in Emu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re-established in Emu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post-genomic level.}

Expression of these genes is controlled by epigenetic modifications on regulatory regions. However, little is known on profiles of trimethylated H3 lysine residues on coding regions of these genes in pluripotent and differentiated cells, and on the interdependence between promoter and exon occupancy of modified H3. Here, we determine how H3K9, H3K27, H3K36 and H3K79 methylation profiles on exons of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 correlate with expression and promoter occupancy. Expression of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in embryonal carcinoma cells is associated with a looser chromatin configuration than mesenchymal progenitors or fibroblasts, determined by H3 occupancy. Promoter H3K27 trimethylation extends into the first exon of repressed OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, while H3K9me3 occupies the first exon of these genes irrespective of expression. Both H3K36me3 and H3K79me3 are enriched on exons of expressed genes, yet with a distinct pattern: H3K36me3 increases towards the 3{${'}$} end of genes, while H3K79me3 is preferentially enriched on first exons. Down-regulation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SetD2 by siRNA causes global and gene-specific H3K36 demethylation and global H3K27 hypermethylation; however it does not affect promoter levels of H3K27me3, suggesting for the genes examined independence of occupancy of H3K27me3 on promoters and H3K36me3 on exons. mRNA levels are however affected, raising the hypothesis of a role of SetD2 on transcription elongation and/or termination. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We show that the CPEB translation factor orb plays a critical role in the reorganization of the MT network. orb appears to function at several levels during MT reorganization. orb interacts genetically with genes encoding Par proteins, aPKC and cdc42, and disrupts the localization of Par-1 and aPKC within the oocyte. orb also plays an important role in organizing the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The defects in the actin cytoskeleton disrupt the cortical association of Shot and Patronin, which are responsible for nucleating the assembly of the anterior MT network.}

Evolutionary conserved TBP2 homologs were also found in human, mouse, frog, and pufferfish. The N-terminal domains of TBP2s are divergent amongst themselves and different from those of TBPs; however, the core domain of TBP2s and TBPs are almost identical. TBP2 binds the TATA box, interacts with TFIIA and TFIIB (similarly to TBP), and can mediate Pol II transcription initiation. However, TBP2 shows contrasting expression patterns in the gonads and during embryonic development in comparison to TBP, suggesting differential function. Knockdown of zebrafish TBP2 results in specific reduction of the protein level, leading to a phenotype, which indicates the requirement of TBP2 for embryonic patterning. The presence of three different TBP family members in vertebrates suggests the existence of developmental stage- and tissue-specific preinitiation complexes with specific requirements for different TBP family members.}

More than the other types of histone modification, acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues on N-terminal histone tails are fundamental for the formation of chromatin domains, such as euchromatin, and facultative and constitutive heterochromatin.

Accumulation of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin does not compensate for silencing; rather, strains deficient for both DCDC and PRC2 exhibit synthetic sensitivity to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin and accumulate {$\gamma$}H2A at heterochromatin.

This work provides information about the cellular consequences of KMT1 and PRC2 deficiency and provides insights into the regulatory and functional relationships of these conserved enzymes., H3K9 methylation directs heterochromatin formation by recruiting multiple heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-containing complexes that deacetylate histones and methylate cytosine bases in DNA. In Neurospora crassa, a single H3K9 methyltransferase complex, called the DIM-5,-7,-9, CUL4, DDB1 Complex (DCDC), is required for normal growth and development. DCDC-deficient mutants are hypersensitive to the genotoxic agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), but the molecular basis of genotoxic stress is unclear. We found that both the MMS sensitivity and growth phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains are suppressed by mutation of embryonic ectoderm development or Su-(var)3-9; E(z); Trithorax (set)-7, encoding components of the H3K27 methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2). Trimethylated histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) undergoes genome-wide redistribution to constitutive heterochromatin in DCDC- or HP1-deficient mutants, and introduction of an H3K27 missense mutation is sufficient to rescue phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains. Accumulation of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin does not compensate for silencing; rather, strains deficient for both DCDC and PRC2 exhibit synthetic sensitivity to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin and accumulate {$\gamma$}H2A at heterochromatin. Together, these data suggest that PRC2 modulates the response to genotoxic stress.},

The etiological spectrum of ultra-rare developmental disorders remains to be fully defined. Chromatin regulatory mechanisms maintain cellular identity and function, where misregulation may lead to developmental defects. Here, we report pathogenic variations in MSL3, which encodes a member of the chromatin-associated male-specific lethal (MSL) complex responsible for bulk histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in flies and mammals. These variants cause an X-linked syndrome affecting both sexes. Clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay, progressive gait disturbance, and recognizable facial dysmorphism. MSL3 mutations affect MSL complex assembly and activity, accompanied by a pronounced loss of H4K16ac levels in vivo. Patient-derived cells display global transcriptome alterations of pathways involved in morphogenesis and cell migration. Finally, we use histone deacetylase inhibitors to rebalance acetylation levels, alleviating some of the molecular and cellular phenotypes of patient cells. Taken together, we characterize a syndrome that allowed us to decipher the developmental importance of MSL3 in humans.}

  abstract = {Although a great deal of information is available concerning the role of ecdysone in insect oogenesis, research has tended to focus on vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. As such, the study of oogenesis in a strict sense has received much less attention. This situation changed recently when a number of observations carried out in the meroistic polytrophic ovarioles of Drosophila melanogaster started to unravel the key roles played by ecdysone in different steps of oogenesis. Thus, in larval stages, a non-autonomous role of ecdysone, first in repression and later in activation, of stem cell niche and primordial germ cell differentiation has been reported. In the adult, ecdysone stimulates the proliferation of germline stem cells, plays a role in stem cell niche maintenance and is needed non-cell-autonomously for correct differentiation of germline stem cells. Moreover, in somatic cells ecdysone is required for 16-cell cyst formation and for ovarian follicle development. In the transition from stages 8 to 9 of oogenesis, ecdysone signalling is fundamental when deciding whether or not to go ahead with vitellogenesis depending on the nutritional status, as well as to start border cell migration.

Transcription-coupled methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 is enriched toward the 3' end of active genes, similar to the MSL proteins. Here, we have studied the link between histone H3 methylation and MSL complex targeting using RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We show that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) relies on the histone methyltransferase Hypb and is localized promoter distal at dosage-compensated genes, similar to active genes on autosomes. However, H3K36me3 has an X-specific function, as reduction specifically decreases acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 on the male X chromosome. This hypoacetylation is caused by compromised MSL binding and results in a failure to increase expression twofold. Thus, H3K36me3 marks the body of all active genes yet is utilized in a chromosome-specific manner to enhance histone acetylation at sites of dosage compensation.}

Earlier studies in which X-linked gene activities were monitored in msl/msl male larvae demonstrated that genes are responsible for setting and/or maintaining the level of X chromosome transcription in males (i.e., they are necessary for proper dosage compensation). The present study examines several important questions concerning their mode of action during development - the results of an examination of the effects of an msl-1 deficiency on male-lethal phase and female viability suggest that this mutation is an amorph, or a severe hypomorph. The effects of rendering a fly mutant for more than one male-lethal mutation were also examined. Multiply mutant flies were no more severely affected than singly mutant ones. A gynandromorph analysis revealed that the male-limited lethality associated with msl-2 has no single lethal focus. Somatic clones of homozygous msl-2 cells were initiated at various times during development by X-ray-induced mitotic recombination. An examination of the viability, growth patterns and morphology of marked clones demonstrated that: msl-2+ acts in a cell autonomous manner, msl-2+ function is required not only in larval (polytene) cells as was shown in previous work but is also needed in the diploid cells that give rise to adult structures, the msl-2+ gene is needed fairly late in development and perhaps continuously, the msl-2 mutation does not affect sexual differentiation.}

This hypothesis was investigated in the aquatic snail Melanoides tuberculata, in which both sexual and parthenogenetic individuals exist in natural populations, and some populations are heavily infested by trematodes. The presence of fertile males and the higher genetic diversity of bisexual populations are indicative of sexual reproduction. We compared sites in 1990, 1999, and 2001, and we looked for a positive correlation between male and parasite frequencies. Male frequency was not correlated with the frequency of individuals infected by trematodes. This lack of correlation was reconfirmed in a retrospective power analysis. In a period of 9 years, male frequencies decreased but infection levels increased. These results do not support the Red Queen hypothesis. In samples with high male frequency the number of embryos was low, perhaps indicating that males may have a negative effect on embryo numbers. This effect of males on fitness could perhaps suggest that the cost of sex is fewer embryos. The reduction in embryo numbers may also represent a trade-off between mating and egg production costs.},

Using the broadest H3K4me3 domains as a discovery tool in neural progenitor cells, we identify novel regulators of these cells. Machine learning models reveal that the broadest H3K4me3 domains represent a distinct entity, characterized by increased marks of elongation. The broadest H3K4me3 domains also have more paused polymerase at their promoters, suggesting a unique transcriptional output. Indeed, genes marked by the broadest H3K4me3 domains exhibit enhanced transcriptional consistency rather than increased transcriptional levels, and perturbation of H3K4me3 breadth leads to changes in transcriptional consistency. Thus, H3K4me3 breadth contains information that could ensure transcriptional precision at key cell identity/function genes. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.}

This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although recent studies have implicated RNA regulation, the mechanism that normally prevents the loss of germ cell identity remains unexplained. In C. elegans, a teratoma is induced in the absence of the conserved RNA-binding protein GLD-1. Here, we demonstrate that GLD-1 represses translation of CYE-1/cyclin E during meiotic prophase, which prevents germ cells from re-entering mitosis and inducing embryonic-like transcription. We describe a mechanism that prevents precocious mitosis in germ cells undergoing meiosis, propose that this mechanism maintains germ cell identity by delaying the onset of embryonic gene activation until after fertilization, and provide a paradigm for the possible origin of human teratomas. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by a plethora of proteins in human cells. The first general transcription factor to bind gene promoters is transcription factor IID (TFIID). TFIID triggers pre-initiation complex formation, functions as a coactivator by interacting with transcriptional activators and reads epigenetic marks. TFIID is a megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Despite its crucial role, the detailed architecture and assembly mechanism of TFIID remain elusive. Histone fold domains are prevalent in TAFs, and histone-like tetramer and octamer structures have been proposed in TFIID. A functional core-TFIID subcomplex was revealed in Drosophila nuclei, consisting of a subset of TAFs (TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF12). These core subunits are thought to be present in two copies in holo-TFIID, in contrast to TBP and other TAFs that are present in a single copy, conveying a transition from symmetry to asymmetry in the TFIID assembly pathway. Here we present the structure of human core-TFIID determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 11.6 \textbackslash AA resolution. Our structure reveals a two-fold symmetric, interlaced architecture, with pronounced protrusions, that accommodates all conserved structural features of the TAFs including the histone folds. We further demonstrate that binding of one TAF8-TAF10 complex breaks the original symmetry of core-TFIID. We propose that the resulting asymmetric structure serves as a functional scaffold to nucleate holo-TFIID assembly, by accreting one copy each of the remaining TAFs and TBP. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Nucleoli are always multiple during the growth period of the oocyte of panoistic ovaries. This is true even in the case of Blattella which seems to possess only one big nucleolus, if examined in the light microscope (cf. Figs. 2 and 14b).-In the meroistic type of ovary (with nurse cells) the development of nucleoli and lampbrush chromosomes in the oocyte is very reduced. Only in the early growth stages of the oocyte the chromosomes despiralisize in a speciesspecific degree before they condense to a karyosphere (Pigs. 8, 9). On the other hand the endobody is bigger in the meroistic than in the panoistic ovary (Figs. 5, 8,14). - Lampbrush chromosomes and multiple nucleoli are sites of a very intensive RNA-synthesis (Fig. 1). The nucleoli are built up by granules measuring 125 \textbackslash AA in diameter (Figs. 15, 16). In the endobody, no RNA-metabolism could be demonstrated (Figs, 1a, b, 8c). The endobody is very homogeneous in electron microscope pictures and clearly distinct from the granular nucleoli (Fig. 17). The labelling pattern after incubation with 3H-amino acids suggests a permanent exchange of protein molecules between the karyoplasm and the endobody. - In the meroistic type of ovary the oocyte obtains RNA from the nurse cells, and RNA-synthesis in the oocyte nucleus is decreased in the same measure as its chromosomes are condensed. - The water-beetles Dytiscus and Acilius possess extra-DNA and deviate from the rule of restricted RNA-synthesis in the oocyte nucleus of the meroistic ovary albeit their chromosomes form a karyosphere too (Fig. 11) and RNA streams also from the nurse chamber into the ooplasm (Fig. 10). The extra-DNA resolves itselve into a network of fine fibrils no longer stainable by the Feulgen reaction. True multiple nucleoli develop on the fibrils suggesting the extra-DNA contains a huge mass of nucleolus organizers. The case of Dytiscus is very similar to the development of the multiple nucleoli in Gryllus. \textcopyright{} 1967 Springer-Verlag.}

Over the past decade, a tremendous amount of progress has led to the characterization of methyl modifications and the lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs) that regulate them. Here, we review the discovery and characterization of the KMTs and KDMs and the methyl modifications they regulate. We discuss the localization of the KMTs and KDMs as well as the distribution of lysine methylation throughout the genome. We highlight how these data have shaped our view of lysine methylation as a key determinant of complex chromatin states. Finally, we discuss the regulation of KMTs and KDMs by proteasomal degradation, posttranscriptional mechanisms, and metabolic status. We propose key questions for the field and highlight areas that we predict will yield exciting discoveries in the years to come. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

Structural and biochemical studies have shown that when TBP binds DNA, it sharply bends the DNA. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study DNA bending by human TBP on consensus and mutant TATA boxes in the absence and presence of TFIIA. We found that the state of the bent DNA within populations of TBP-DNA complexes is homogeneous; partially bent intermediates were not observed. In contrast to the results of previous ensemble studies, TBP was found to bend a mutant TATA box to the same extent as the consensus TATA box. Moreover, in the presence of TFIIA, the extent of DNA bending was not significantly changed, although TFIIA did increase the fraction of DNA molecules bound by TBP. Analysis of the kinetics of DNA bending and unbending revealed that on the consensus TATA box two kinetically distinct populations of TBP-DNA complexes exist; however, the bent state of the DNA is the same in the two populations. Our smFRET studies reveal that human TBP bends DNA in a largely uniform manner under a variety of different conditions, which was unexpected given previous ensemble biochemical studies. Our new observations led to us to revise the model for the mechanism of DNA binding by TBP and for how DNA bending is affected by TATA sequence and TFIIA. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Due to silencing of the genome during meiotic divisions, there is little instructive transcription, barring a few examples, to mediate these critical transitions. In Drosophila, several layers of post-transcriptional regulation ensure that the mRNAs required for these processes are expressed in a timely manner and as needed during germline differentiation. These layers of regulation include alternative splicing, RNA modification, ribosome production, and translational repression. Many of the molecules and pathways involved in these regulatory activities are conserved from Drosophila to humans making the Drosophila germline an elegant model for studying the role of post-transcriptional regulation during stem cell differentiation and meiosis.},

The karyosphere is an evolutionarily conserved but morphologically rather ``multifaceted'' structure. It forms at the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase in many animals, from hydra and Drosophila to human. Karyosphere formation is generally linked with transcriptional silencing of the genome. It is believed that karyosphere/karyosome is a prerequisite for proper completion of meiotic divisions and further development. Here, a brief review on the karyosphere features in some invertebrates and vertebrates is provided. Special emphasis is made on terminology, since current discrepancies in this field may lead to confusions. In particular, it is proposed to distinguish the karyosphere with a capsule and the karyosome (a karyosphere devoid of a capsule). The ``inverted'' karyospheres are also considered, in which the chromosomes situate externally to an extrachromosomal structure (e.g., in human oocytes).},

  abstract = {Although it is accepted that, with exceptions, almost every DNA double-strand break (DSB) forms a gammaH2AX focus, whether every gammaH2AX focus identifies a DSB remains controversial86. It is generally not possible to independently determine the presence of a DSB because visualization of gammaH2AX foci is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than other methods of DSB detection. It has been reported, for example, that gammaH2AX foci may persist over time in some tumour cells after the initiating DSBs have been rejoined130. However, as DSBs disrupt chromatin, complete repair also involves restoring the original chromatin conformation, which may also be facilitated by the presence of gammaH2AX foci. In addition, the formation of extremely small gammaH2AX 'microfoci' has been observed in the nuclei of senescent primary cells and in certain cancer cell types87, 131. These microfoci differ from normal foci in that they do not increase in size and they do not contain other DNA repair factors. The function of these structures in the cell has yet to be determined. There are, however, several more definitive cases of gammaH2AX formation that are not due to DSBs, although in these cases gammaH2AX does not form a focal pattern. One example is found in the testis during spermatogenesis79. During pachytene the sex body (the condensed X\textendash Y chromosome pair) remains completely covered with gammaH2AX independent of recombination-associated DSBs. Another example of gammaH2AX formation without focus formation occurs following cell exposure to ultraviolet C34 and during apoptosis167. The primary lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation can cause replication stress that may induce DSB formation leading to gammaH2AX foci formation132. However, during G1, pan-nuclear staining has been observed that seems to be dependent on nucleotide-excision repair machinery34. Additionally, a similar global gammaH2AX DNA staining has been observed during mitosis in some cell types133. Finally, a surprising recent report showed that gammaH2AX is localized \textemdash{} along with other DNA repair proteins \textemdash{} to the centrosome, an organelle that reportedly lacks DNA134. With these exceptions in mind, however, the gammaH2AX focus remains the most sensitive way to detect a DSB. Future work may elucidate the relationship of these other gammaH2AX patterns to gammaH2AX foci.}

Surprisingly, recent studies revealed little overlap between genome-wide SAGA-binding profiles and changes in gene expression upon depletion of subunits of the complex. As indicators of SAGA recruitment on chromatin, we monitored in yeast and human cells the genome-wide distribution of histone H3K9 acetylation and H2B ubiquitination, which are respectively deposited or removed by SAGA. Changes in these modifications after inactivation of the corresponding enzyme revealed that SAGA acetylates the promoters and deubiquitinates the transcribed region of all expressed genes. In agreement with this broad distribution, we show that SAGA plays a critical role for RNA polymerase II recruitment at all expressed genes. In addition, through quantification of newly synthesized RNA, we demonstrated that SAGA inactivation induced a strong decrease of mRNA synthesis at all tested genes. Analysis of the SAGA deubiquitination activity further revealed that SAGA acts on the whole transcribed genome in a very fast manner, indicating a highly dynamic association of the complex with chromatin. Thus, our study uncovers a new function for SAGA as a bone fide cofactor for all RNA polymerase II transcription.},

In Drosophila melanogaster a single H2A variant, H2A.V, combines functions of mammalian H2A.Z and H2A.X in transcription regulation and the DNA damage response. A major role in H2A.V incorporation for the only SWR1-like enzyme in flies, Domino, is assumed but not well documented in vivo. It is also unclear whether the two alternatively spliced isoforms, DOM-A and DOM-B, have redundant or specialized functions. Loss of both DOM isoforms compromises oogenesis, causing female sterility. We systematically explored roles of the two DOM isoforms during oogenesis using a cell type-specific knockdown approach. Despite their ubiquitous expression, DOM-A and DOM-B have non-redundant functions in germline and soma for egg formation. We show that chromatin incorporation of H2A.V in germline and somatic cells depends on DOM-B, whereas global incorporation in endoreplicating germline nurse cells appears to be independent of DOM. By contrast, DOM-A promotes the removal of H2A.V from stage 5 nurse cells. Remarkably, therefore, the two DOM isoforms have distinct functions in cell type-specific development and H2A.V exchange.},

These configurations have been termed, respectively, SN (surrounded nucleolus) and NSN (nonsurrounded nucleolus). Work from our and other laboratories has revealed ultrastructural and functional differences between these two configurations. The aims of the present study were 1) to analyze the equilibrium between the SN and the NSN population as a function of the age of the mice and the time after hCG-induced ovulation and 2) to study the polymerase I (pol I)- and polymerase II (pol II)-dependent transcription in both types of oocytes through the detection of bromouridine incorporated into nascent RNA. We show 1) that ovarian GV oocytes exhibiting the SN-type configuration can be found as soon as 17 days after birth in the C57/CBA mouse strain and 2) that the SN:NSN ratio of ovarian GV oocytes is very low just after hCG-induced ovulation and then increases progressively with the time after ovulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SN configuration correlates strictly with the arrest of both pol I- and pol II-dependent transcription in mice at any age. Finally, we show that ribosomal genes are located at the outer periphery of the nucleolus in the NSN configuration and that pol I-dependent perinucleolar transcription sites correspond to specific ultrastructural features of the nucleolus. Altogether, these results provide clear-cut criteria delineating transcriptionally active GV oocytes from those that are inactive, and confirm that the SN-type configuration is mostly present in preovulatory oocytes.}

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure. PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency, but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys 27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Our results indicate that dynamic repression of developmental pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

Each of these cell types arise from mesodermal cells that constitute the embryonic gonad. To explore the mechanisms governing the development and differentiation of these cells, we focus on the formation of the gonad during Drosophila development. Using markers for the precursors of the somatic cells of the gonad, we identify discrete steps in the development of the gonad. Our results suggest the existence of different populations of gonadal precursors at early stages in gonadogenesis that represent precursors of cell types found within the adult gonad. The functions of the homeotic genes abdominal A and Abdominal B are required for the development of gonadal precursors, however, here we provide evidence that each plays a distinct role. abd A activity alone specifies anterior gonadal precursor fates, whereas abd A and Abd B act together to specify a posterior subpopulation of gonadal precursors. Once specified, gonadal precursors born within posterior parasegments must move to the site of gonad formation. Here, we show that the proper regional identities, as established by homeotic gene function, are required for the arrest of migration at the correct position. Finally, our analysis of late stages of gonadogenesis suggests that abd A is required in a population of cells within parasegments 10 and 11 that partially ensheath the coalescing gonad. Mutations in iab-4 abolish expression of abd A within these cells, and as a result block the coalescence of the gonad.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Embryology provides an essential key to understanding the structure and function of the normal urinary tract and the origins of the congenital anomalies encountered in urological practice. The conventional study of embryology, supplemented by additional information from scanning electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, has provided us with a detailed picture of the developmental anatomy of the embryo and fetus. Now, equipped with the powerful new research methods of molecular biology, notably polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization, researchers can study the genetic mechanisms regulating this complex and tightly ordered anatomical sequence. As well as mapping and sequencing genes, research is under way to isolate the many gene products responsible for implementing the genetic `programme' encoded on DNA at a cellular and molecular level. Moreover, the function of specific genes is being extensively documented by studying the consequences of experimentally induced null or `knockout' gene deletions in experimental rodents. The successful culture of pluripotent embryonic stem cells,1 coupled with changes in the law permitting research into therapeutic cloning of early embryonic tissue, may ultimately pave the way to the use of a wide range of human cells for tissue reconstruction or regenerative repair. Advances in the new science of developmental biology will create new opportunities for the diagnosis, prevention and possible treatment of inherited disorders and genetically determined anomalies of the genitourinary system. However, these opportunities will also bring new responsibilities and ethical dilemmas. Much of this chapter is devoted to a practical, clinically orientated account of developmental anatomy, but it would be incomplete without some consideration of genetics and the rapidly advancing field of developmental biology.},

Conditional inactivation and ectopic tethering experiments support a direct role for the TFs Gcn4 and Nup2 in mediating interaction with the NPC but suggest an indirect role for factors involved in mRNA export or transcription. A conserved ``positioning domain'' within Gcn4 controls interaction with the NPC and inter-chromosomal clustering and promotes transcription of target genes. Such a function may be quite common; a comprehensive screen reveals that tethering of most yeast TFs is sufficient to promote targeting to the NPC. While some TFs require Nup100, others do not, suggesting two distinct targeting mechanisms. These results highlight an important and underappreciated function of TFs in controlling the spatial organization of the yeast genome through interaction with the NPC.},

  abstract = {The KDM5 family of histone demethylases removes the H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) mark frequently found at promoter regions of actively transcribed genes and is therefore generally considered to contribute to corepression. In this study, we show that knockdown (KD) of all expressed members of the KDM5 family in white and brown preadipocytes leads to deregulated gene expression and blocks differentiation to mature adipocytes. KDM5 KD leads to a considerable increase in H3K4me3 at promoter regions; however, these changes in H3K4me3 have a limited effect on gene expression per se. By contrast, genome-wide analyses demonstrate that KDM5A is strongly enriched at KDM5-activated promoters, which generally have high levels of H3K4me3 and are associated with highly expressed genes. We show that KDM5-activated genes include a large set of cell cycle regulators and that the KDM5s are necessary for mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that KDM5 KD may interfere with differentiation in part by impairing proliferation. Notably, the demethylase activity of KDM5A is required for activation of at least a subset of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes. In conclusion, the KDM5 family acts as dual modulators of gene expression in preadipocytes and is required for early stage differentiation and activation of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes.}

The imbalance in expression of several hundred genes is lethal if not dealt with by dosage compensation. The male\textendash female difference is addressed by silencing of genes on one female X early in development. However, both males and females now have only one active X chromosome. This is compensated by twofold up-regulation of genes on the active X. This complex system continues to provide important insights into mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.}

  abstract = {Optimized weight matrices defining four major eukaryotic promoter elements, the TATA-box, cap signal, CCAAT-, and GC-box, are presented; they were derived by comparative sequence analysis of 502 unrelated RNA polymerase II promoter regions. The new TATA-box and cap signal descriptions differ in several respects from the only hitherto available base frequency Tables. The CCAAT-box matrix, obtained with no prior assumption but CCAAT being the core of the motif, reflects precisely the sequence specificity of the recently discovered nuclear factor NY-I/CP1 but does not include typical recognition sequences of two other purported CCAAT-binding proteins, CTF and CBP. The GC-box description is longer than the previously proposed consensus sequences but is consistent with Sp1 protein-DNA binding data. The notion of a CACCC element distinct from the GC-box seems not to be justified any longer in view of the new weight matrix. Unlike the two fixed-distance elements, neither the CCAAT- nor the GC-box occurs at significantly high frequency in the upstream regions of non-vertebrate genes. Preliminary attempts to predict promoters with the aid of the new signal descriptions were unexpectedly successful. The new TATA-box matrix locates eukaryotic transcription initiation sites as reliably as do the best currently available methods to map Escherichia coli promoters. This analysis was made possible by the recently established Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library. In order to derive the weight matrices, a novel algorithm has been devised that is generally applicable to sequence motifs positionally correlated with a biologically defined position in the sequences. The signal must be sufficiently over-represented in a particular region relative to the given site, but need not be present in all members of the input sequence collection. The algorithm iteratively redefines the set of putative motif representatives from which a weight matrix is derived, so as to maximize a quantitative measure of local over-representation, an optimization criterion that naturally combines structural and positional constancy. A comprehensive description of the technique is presented in Methods and Data. \textcopyright{} 1990.}

We demonstrate in vivo that Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal D (BicD), maternal proteins required for oocyte determination, are selectively recruited by, and co-transported with, localizing transcripts in blastoderm embryos, and that interfering with the activities of Egl and BicD blocks apical localization.

Our laboratory studies show how various mRNAprocessing and chromatin-modifying enzymes interact with the phosphorylated CTD to efficiently produce mRNAs. The H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 interacts with CTD carrying phosphorylations characteristic of downstream elongation complexes, and the resulting cotranscriptional H3K36 methylation targets the Rpd3S histone deacetylase to downstream transcribed regions. Although positively correlated with gene activity, this pathway actually inhibits transcription elongation as well as initiation from cryptic promoters within genes. During early elongation, CTD serine 5 phosphorylation helps recruit the H3K4 methyltransferase complex containing Set1. Within 5{${'}$} transcribed regions, cotranscriptional H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) by Set1 recruits the deacetylase complex Set3C. Finally, H3K4 trimethylation at the most promoter-proximal nucleosomes is thought to stimulate transcription by promoting histone acetylation by complexes containing the ING/Yng PHD finger proteins. Surprisingly, the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex, normally a transcription repressor, may also recognize H3K4me3. Together, the cotranscriptional histone methylations appear to function primarily to distinguish active promoter regions, which are marked by high levels of acetylation and nucleosome turnover, from the deacetylated, downstream transcribed regions of genes. \textcopyright{} 2010 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

DNase I footprinting of the binding of eTFIID to TATA-less promoters revealed that the factor protected a region that extended from the initiation site sequence (about +1) to {$\sim$}35 nucleotides downstream of the RNA start site. In contrast, there was no apparent upstream DNase I protection or hypersensitivity induced by eTFIID in the -25 to -30 region at which TATA motifs are typically located. Further studies revealed a conserved sequence motif, (A)/(G)G(A)/(T)CGTG, termed the downstream promoter element (DPE), which is located {$\sim$}30 nucleotides downstream of the RNA start site of many TATA-less promoters. DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription experiments revealed that a DPE in its normal downstream location is necessary for transcription of DPE-containing TATA-less promoters and can compensate for the disruption of an upstream TATA box of a TATA-containing promoter. Moreover, a systematic mutational analysis of DNA sequences that encompass the DPE confirmed the importance of the consensus DPE sequence motif for basal transcription and further supports the postulate that the DPE is a distinct, downstream basal promoter element. These results suggest that the DPE acts in conjunction with the initiation site sequence to provide a binding site for TFIID in the absence of a TATA box to mediate transcription of TATA-less promoters.},

TFIIB is normally associated with the early elongation complex and is only destabilized at +12 to +13. However, if TFIIF is not retained in the PIC, TFIIB can be lost immediately after initiation.

The relationship of this amplification to the follicle cell cycles has remained unclear. To investigate the regulation of amplification, we developed a technique to detect amplifying chorion genes in individual follicle cells using BrdU incorporation and FISH. Amplification occurs in two developmental phases. One of the gene clusters begins to amplify periodically during S phases of follicle cell endocycles. Subsequently, after endocycles have ceased, both clusters amplify continuously during the remainder of oogenesis. In contrast to the early phase, late amplification commences synchronously among follicle cells. The pattern of Cyclin E expression mirrors these two phases. We present evidence that Cyclin E is required positively for amplification. We suggest that Cyclin E also acts negatively to inhibit refiring of most origins within a cycle, and that specific factors at chorion origins allow them to escape this negative rereplication control. Our findings suggest that chorion amplification is a model for understanding metazoan replicons and the controls that restrict replication to once per cell cycle.},

Molecular communication between the two compartments involves active, signal-mediated trafficking, a function that is exclusively performed by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The individual NPC components and the mechanisms that are involved in nuclear trafficking are well documented and have become textbook knowledge. However, in addition to their roles as nuclear gatekeepers, NPC components-nucleoporins-have been shown to have critical roles in chromatin organization and gene regulation. These findings have sparked new enthusiasm to study the roles of this multiprotein complex in nuclear organization and explore novel functions that in some cases appear to go beyond a role in transport. Here, we discuss our present view of NPC biogenesis, which is tightly linked to proper cell cycle progression and cell differentiation. In addition, we summarize new data suggesting that NPCs represent dynamic hubs for the integration of gene regulation and nuclear transport processes.},

Each of the typically 2,000-4,000 pores in the NE of vertebrate cells is composed of multiple copies of 30 different proteins known as nucleoporins. The evolutionarily conserved NPC proteins have the well-characterized function of mediating the transport of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. Mutations in nucleoporins are often linked to specific developmental defects and disease, and the resulting phenotypes are usually interpreted as the consequences of perturbed nuclear transport activity. However, recent evidence suggests that NPCs have additional functions in chromatin organization and gene regulation, some of which might be independent of nuclear transport. Here, we review the transport-dependent and transport-independent roles of NPCs in the regulation of nuclear function and gene expression.},

Both complexes shared a three subunit core and Rpd3L contains unique subunits consistent with being a promoter targeted corepressor. Rco1 and Eaf3 were subunits specific to Rpd3S. Mutants of RCO1 and EAF3 exhibited increased acetylation in the FLO8 and STE11 open reading frames (ORFs) and the appearance of aberrant transcripts initiating within the body of these ORFs. Mutants in the RNA polymerase II-associated SET2 histone methyltransferase also displayed these defects. Set2 functioned upstream of Rpd3S and the Eaf3 methyl-histone binding chromodomain was important for recruitment of Rpd3S and for deacetylation within the STE11 ORF. These data indicate that Pol II-associated Set2 methylates H3 providing a transcriptional memory which signals for deacetylation of ORFs by Rpd3S. This erases transcription elongation-associated acetylation to suppress intragenic transcription initiation. Copyright \textcopyright 2005 by Elsevier Inc.}

Previous studies have implicated TAF(II)250 and TAF(II)150 in core promoter selectivity of RNA polymerase II. Here, we have used a random DNA binding site selection procedure to identify target sequences for these TAFs. Individually, neither TAF(II)250 nor TAF(II)150 singles out a clearly constrained DNA sequence. However, a TAF(II)250-TAF(II)150 complex selects sequences that match the Initiator (Inr) consensus. When in a trimeric complex with TBP, these TAFs select Inr sequences at the appropriate distance from the TATA-box. Point mutations that inhibit binding of the TAF(II)250-TAF(II)150 complex also impair Inr function in reconstituted basal transcription reactions, underscoring the functional relevance of Inr recognition by TAFs. Surprisingly, the precise DNA sequence at the start site of transcription influences transcriptional regulation by the upstream activator Sp1. Finally, we found that TAF(II)150 specifically binds to four-way junction DNA, suggesting that promoter binding by TFIID may involve recognition of DNA structure as well as primary sequence. Taken together, our results establish that TAF(II)250 and TAF(II)150 bind the Inr directly and that Inr recognition can determine the responsiveness of a promoter to an activator.},

Here we show that nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers characterizes senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation in human fibroblasts. However, the global landscape of these repressive marks remains unchanged upon SAHF formation, suggesting that in somatic cells, heterochromatin can be formed through the spatial repositioning of pre-existing repressively marked histones. This model is reinforced by the correlation of presenescent replication timing with both the subsequent layered structure of SAHFs and the global landscape of the repressive marks, allowing us to integrate microscopic and genomic information. Furthermore, modulation of SAHF structure does not affect the occupancy of these repressive marks, nor vice versa. These experiments reveal that high-order heterochromatin formation and epigenetic remodeling of the genome can be discrete events. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

  journal = {West Coast Worm Meeting},
  abstract = {The meiosis cell cycle program allows diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes by directing the successive segregation of homologs and then sister chromatids following a single round of replication. The information to direct homolog disjunction and then sister-chromatid segregation is contained within the highly organized chromosomes in prophase by the time homolog pairs are packaged into compact units called bivalents (1). A bivalent structure is composed of two homologs held in an end-to-end orientation and is produced by a series of hierarchical structural and organizational changes to meiotic chromosomes, including the reciprocal exchange of chromatids (crossover) between homologs in pachytene and the compaction and restructuring of chromatids around the crossover site in diplotene and diakinesis. While a number of genes have been identified that affect bivalent formation through their involvement in crossover formation, little is known about the genes that are responsible for the individualization and compaction of chromatids in diplotene and diakinesis. Long-standing models for bivalent formation propose that chromatid restructuring may be driven by DNA compaction, however experimental proof of these models has been elusive because mutations that specifically affect chromosome compaction in diplotene-diakinesis have been lacking. Nonetheless, candidates for implementing meiotic chromosome compaction at diplotene-diakinesis exist and include members of the conserved condensin protein complexes. In mitosis, condensin activity is required to compact and resolve chromosomes for accurate chromosome segregation, and the depletion of condensin in C. elegans and in other model organisms specifically impedes prophase DNA compaction. The prototypical condensin complex contains at least five subunits, including a pair of s tructural m aintenance of c hromosomes (SMC) proteins, SMC2 and SMC4. The three non-SMC ancillary factors belong to c hromosome- a ssociated p olypeptide CAP-D2, CAP-G and CAP-H/Barren families. The C. elegans SMC homologs, MIX-1 (SMC2) and SMC-4 form a protein complex (2). Although candidates for the C. elegans non-SMC homologs have been identified based on protein sequence homology and mutant phenotype (3,4), their association with this complex has not demonstrated. To define additional condensin genes and to explore condensin's role in meiosis, we set forth to biochemically define factors associated with the MIX-1 in embryonic extracts. We identified the h olocentric c hromosome binding p rotein 6 (HCP-6) (4) as a componentof the MIX-1/SMC-4 condensin complex that functions in chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. Surprisingly, the requirements for condensin assembly on meiotic chromosomes differ from requirements for assembly on mitotic chromosomes. Characterization of HCP-6 and condensin in meiosis showed that condensin functions as a chromosome restructuring factor in diplotene and diakinesis and is required for both homolog and sister-chromatid meiotic divisions. HCP-6's enrichment on DNA was first detected in late prophase after the exit from pachytene. Severe disruption of condensin inhibited chromosome compaction and bivalent formation in diplotene/diakinesis. Interestingly, weak condensin mutations disrupted chromatid structure but did not affect bivalent compaction and formation, thereby demonstrating separable roles for condensin in DNA compaction and restructuring. Most importantly, condensin mutations suppressed the precocious separation of sister chromatids and homologs at diakinesis in mutants defective for sister-chromatid cohesion and crossover recombination, demonstrating condensin's role in resolving sister chromatids and homologs prior to metaphase I.

  abstract = {Defined culture systems supporting spermatogonial differentiation will provide experimental platforms to study spermatogenesis. However, germline-intrinsic signaling mechanisms sufficient to support spermatogonial differentiation without somatic cells remain largely undefined. Here we analyzed EGF superfamily receptor and ligand diversity in rat testis cells and delineated germline-intrinsic signaling via an ERBB3 co-transducer, ERBB2, as essential for retinoic acid-induced syncytial growth by differentiating spermatogonia. Similar to the ERBB2/3 agonist NRG1, we found that KIT Ligand (KITL) robustly supported spermatogonial differentiation without serum or somatic cells. ERBB2 inhibitors failed to disrupt KITL-dependent spermatogonial development, and KITL prevented ERBB3-deficient spermatogonial degeneration upon differentiation. Thus we report that NRG1 and KITL activate alternative pathways downstream of retinoic acid signaling in the germline that are essential for stem cells to undergo premeiotic steps of spermatogenesis in culture. Robust serum/soma-free spermatogonial differentiation opens new doors to study mammalian germ cell biology in culture and to discover factors that can drive meiotic progression in vitro.}

Here, we study the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates Tsix, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to decreased Tsix expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, enhanced accumulation of Xist and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, Tsix-independent repression of Xist by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs.Gene expression is controlled by a complicated network of mechanisms involving a wide range of enzymes and protein complexes. Many of these mechanisms are identical in males and females, but some are not. Female mammals, for example, carry two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome. Since the two X chromosomes in females contain essentially the same set of genes, one of them undergoes silencing to prevent the overproduction of certain proteins. This process, which is called X-inactivation, occurs during different stages of development and it must be tightly controlled.An enzyme called MOF was originally found in flies in two distinct complexes\textemdash the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which forms only in males, and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which is ubiquitous in both males and females. These complexes are evolutionary conserved and are also found in mammals. While mammalian MOF is reasonably well understood, the MSL and NSL complexes are not, so Chelmicki, D\"undar et al. have used various sequencing techniques, in combination with biochemical experiments, to investigate their roles in embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells in mice.These experiments show that MSL and NSL complexes engage in the regulation of thousands of genes. Although the two complexes often show different gene preferences, they often regulate the same cellular processes. The MSL/NSL-dependent regulation of X chromosome inactivation is a prime example of this phenomenon.The MSL complex reduces the production of an RNA molecule called Xist, which is responsible for the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females. The NSL complex, meanwhile, ensures the production of multiple proteins that are crucial for the development of embryonic stem cells, and are also involved in the repression of X inactivation.This analysis sheds light on how different complexes can cooperate and complement each other in order to reach the same goal in the cell. The knowledge gained from this study will pave the way towards better understanding of complex processes such as embryonic development, organogenesis and the pathogenesis of disorders like cancer.}

In the Drosophila ovary, signaling events between germline and somatic follicle cells establish the axes of the egg and the future embryo [, ]. A meiotic checkpoint which monitors double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) and involves the Drosophila ATR and Chk2 homologs, coordinates the meiotic cell cycle with these signaling events. Activity of the checkpoint affects the translation of the transforming growth factor-alpha like Gurken signaling molecule which normally induces dorsal cell fates in the follicle cells ([], [], []). We found that mutations in the Drosophila gene cutoff (cuff) affect germline cyst development and result in ventralized eggs due to reduced Grk protein expression. Surprisingly, we found that cuff mutations lead to a marked increase in the transcript levels of two retro-transposable elements, Het-A and Tart. Tagged Cuff protein shows a peri-nuclear localization in the nurse cells, similar to components of the RNAi machinery. We found that a small interfering RNA against the roo element is still produced in cuff mutant ovaries. These results indicate that Cuff is involved in the rasiRNA pathway, most likely acting downstream of siRNA biogenesis. The eggshell and egg laying defects of cuff mutants are suppressed by a mutation in chk2. We also found that mutations in aubergine (aub), another Drosophila gene implicated in the rasiRNA pathway, are also significantly suppressed by the chk2 mutation. Our results indicate that mutants in rasiRNA pathways lead to elevated transposition incidents in the germline, which activates a checkpoint that causes a loss of germ cells and a reduction of Gurken protein in the remaining egg chambers.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila germline lineage depends on a complex microenvironment of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate the self-renewing and asymmetric divisions of dedicated stem cells. Germline stem cells (GSCs) must express components of the Dpp cassette and the translational repressors Nanos and Pumilio, whereas cystoblasts require the bam andbgcn genes. Bam is especially attractive as a target of GSC differentiation factors because current evidence indicates that bamis both necessary and sufficient for cystoblast differentiation. In this paper, we have sought to distinguish between mutually exclusive transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms as the primary regulators of bam expression in GSCs and cystoblasts. We find that bamtranscription is active in young germ cells but is repressed specifically in GSCs. Activation depends on a 50 bp fragment that carries at least one germ cell-specific enhancer element. A non-overlapping 18 bp sequence carries a transcriptional silencer that prevents bam expression in the GSC. Promoters lacking this silencer cause bam expression in the GSC and concomitant GSC loss. Thus, asymmetry of the GSC division can be reduced to identifying the mechanism that selectively activates the silencer element in GSCs.},

The mechanisms that link stromal cell signaling to self-renewal and asymmetry are only beginning to be identified, but Drosophila oogenic germline stem cells (GSCs) have emerged as an important model for studying stem cell niches. A member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand family, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), sustains ovarian GSCs by suppressing differentiation in the stem cell niche (Figure 1A). Dpp overexpression expands the niche, blocks germ cell differentiation, and causes GSC hyperplasty. Here, we show that the bag-of-marbles (bam) differentiation factor is the principal target of Dpp signaling in GSCs; ectopic bam expression restores differentiation even when Dpp is overexpressed. We show that the transcriptional silencer element in the bam gene integrates Dpp control of bam expression. Finally and most significantly, we demonstrate for the first time that Dpp signaling regulates bam expression directly since the bam silencer element is a strong binding site for the Drosophila Smads, Mad and Medea. These studies provide a simple mechanistic explanation for how stromal cell signals regulate both the self-renewal and asymmetric fates of the products of stem cell division.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a continuous and productive process supported by the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which arise from undifferentiated precursors known as gonocytes and are strictly controlled in a special 'niche' microenvironment in the seminiferous tubules. Sertoli cells, the only somatic cell type in the tubules, directly interact with SSCs to control their proliferation and differentiation through the secretion of specific factors. Spermatocyte meiosis is another key step of spermatogenesis, which is regulated by Sertoli cells on the luminal side of the blood-testis barrier through paracrine signaling. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of Sertoli cells in the regulation of SSC self-renewal and spermatocyte meiosis, with particular emphasis on paracrine and endocrine-mediated signaling pathways. Sertoli cell growth factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), as well as Sertoli cell transcription factors, such as ETS variant 5 (ERM; also known as ETV5), nociceptin, neuregulin 1 (NRG1), and androgen receptor (AR), have been identified as the most important upstream factors that regulate SSC self-renewal and spermatocyte meiosis. Other transcription factors and signaling pathways (GDNF-RET-GFRA1 signaling, FGF2-MAP2K1 signaling, CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling, CCL9-CCR1 signaling, FSH-nociceptin/OPRL1, retinoic acid/FSH-NRG/ERBB4, and AR/RB-ARID4A/ARID4B) are also addressed.}

SSCs self-renew or differentiate into spermatogonia that proliferate to give rise to spermatocytes and maintain spermatogenesis. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is essential for this process. Sertoli cells produce GDNF and other growth factors and are commonly thought to be responsible for regulating SSC development, but limited attention has been paid to the role of PM cells in this process. A conditional knockout (cKO) of the androgen receptor gene in PM cells resulted in male infertility. We found that testosterone (T) induces GDNF expression in mouse PM cells in vitro and neonatal spermatogonia (including SSCs) co-cultured with T-treated PM cells were able to colonize testes of germ cell-depleted mice after transplantation. This strongly suggested that T-regulated production of GDNF by PM cells is required for spermatogonial development, but PM cells might produce other factors in vitro that are responsible. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of GDNF by PM cells is essential for spermatogonial development by generating mice with a cKO of the Gdnf gene in PM cells. The cKO males sired up to two litters but became infertile due to collapse of spermatogenesis and loss of undifferentiated spermatogonia. These studies show for the first time, to our knowledge, that the production of GDNF by PM cells is essential for undifferentiated spermatogonial cell development in vivo.},

This mutant also leads to preferential transcription of downstream start sites on some promoters in vivo. To explore the molecular nature of these phenotypes, the TFIIB E62K mutant was characterized in vitro. The mutant interacts with TATA-binding protein normally. In three different assays, the mutant can also interact with RNA polymerase II and recruit it and the other basal transcription factors to a promoter. Despite the ability to assemble a transcription complex, the TFIIB E62K protein is severely defective in transcription in vitro. Therefore, the role of TFIIB must be more than simply bridging TATA- binding protein and polymerase at the promoter. We propose that the region around Glu-62 in yeast TFIIB plays a role in start site selection, perhaps mediating a conformational change in the polymerase or the DNA during the search for initiation sites. This step may be related to the yeast-specific spacing between TATA elements and start sites since mutations of the corresponding glutamate in mammalian TFIIB do not produce a similar effect.}

Embryos that develop within these mutant eggs display posterior patterning defects and abnormal dorsoventral axis formation.

Orb protein, which is localized within the oocyte in wild- type females, is distributed ubiquitously in stage 8-10 orb mutant oocytes.

This analysis revealed that TFIID coexists in two predominant and distinct structural states that differ by a 100 \textbackslash AA translocation of TFIID's lobe A. The transition between these structural states is modulated by TFIIA, as the presence of TFIIA and promoter DNA facilitates the formation of a rearranged state of TFIID that enables promoter recognition and binding. DNA labeling and footprinting, together with cryo-EM studies, were used to map the locations of TATA, Initiator (Inr), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream core promoter element (DPE) promoter motifs within the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA structure.

However, the progression from stem cell self-renewal to overt signs of early differentiation is a poorly understood but important problem in stem cell biology. The Caenorhabditis elegans germ line provides a genetically defined model for studying that progression. In this system, a single-celled mesenchymal niche, the distal tip cell (DTC), employs GLP-1/Notch signaling and an RNA regulatory network to balance self-renewal and early differentiation within the "mitotic region," which continuously self-renews while generating new gametes. Here, we investigate germ cells in the mitotic region for their capacity to differentiate and their state of maturation. Two distinct pools emerge. The "distal pool" is maintained by the DTC in an essentially uniform and immature or "stem cell-like" state; the "proximal pool," by contrast, contains cells that are maturing toward early differentiation and are likely transit-amplifying cells. A rough estimate of pool sizes is 30-70 germ cells in the distal immature pool and {$\approx$}150 in the proximal transit-amplifying pool. We present a simple model for how the network underlying the switch between self-renewal and early differentiation may be acting in these two pools. According to our model, the self-renewal mode of the network maintains the distal pool in an immature state, whereas the transition between self-renewal and early differentiation modes of the network underlies the graded maturation of germ cells in the proximal pool. We discuss implications of this model for controls of stem cells more broadly.},

Data obtained mostly from studies on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggest that Ada2 potentiates Gcn5 activity and substrate recognition. dAda2b, one of two related Ada2 proteins of Drosophila melanogaster, was recently found to play a role in complexes acetylating histone 3 (H3). Evidence of an in vivo functional link between the related coactivator dAda2a and dGcn5, however, is lacking. Here we present data on the genetic interaction of dGcn5 and dAda2a. The loss of either dGcn5 or dAda2a function results in similar chromosome structural and developmental defects. In dAda2a mutants, the nucleosomal H4 acetylation at lysines 12 and 5 is significantly reduced, while the acetylation established by dAda2b-containing Gcn5 complexes at H3 lysines 9 and 14 is unaffected. The data presented here, together with our earlier data on the function of dAda2b, provide evidence that related Ada2 proteins of Drosophila, together with Gcn5 HAT, are involved in the acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of nucleosomal H3 and H4. Our data suggest dAda2a involvement in both uniformly distributed H4 acetylation and gene-specific transcription regulation.},

We have determined the 2.3 \textbackslash AA crystal structure of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of PCAF bound to coenzyme A. The structure reveals a central protein core associated with coenzyme A binding and a pronounced cleft that sits over the protein core and is flanked on opposite sides by the N- and C-terminal protein segments. A correlation of the structure with the extensive mutagenesis data for PCAF and the homologous yeast GCN5 protein implicates the cleft and the N- and C-terminal protein segments as playing an important role in histone substrate binding, and a glutamate residue in the protein core as playing an essential catalytic role. A structural comparison with the coenzyme-bound forms of the related N-acetyltransferases, HAT1 (yeast histone acetyltransferase 1) and SmAAT (Serratia marcescens aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase), suggests the mode of substrate binding and catalysis by these enzymes and establishes a paradigm for understanding the structure-function relationships of other enzymes that acetylate histones and transcriptional regulators to promote activated transcription.},

Neuropeptides represent a major group of signaling molecules that outnumber all other types of neurotransmitters/ modulators and hormones. By means of bioinformatics 119 (neuro)peptide precursor genes have been predicted from the Drosophila genome. Using the neuropeptidomics technology 46 neuropeptides derived from 19 of these precursors could be biochemically characterized. At the cellular level, neuropeptides usually exert their action by binding to membrane receptors, many of which belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors or GPCRs. Such receptors are the major target for many contemporary drugs. In this chapter, we will describe the identification, localization and functional characterization of neuropeptide-receptor pairs in Drosophila melanogaster. \textcopyright{} 2010 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.},

The role of these sequences in the production of functional mRNAs was studied by analyzing a series of mutants containing deletions or substitutions in the SV40 early region poly(A) site. As expected, both a previously defined GU-rich downstream element and an AAUAAA sequence were required for efficient usage of the wild-type poly(A) addition site. However, when either of these elements was deleted, greatly increased levels of SV40-specific RNA were detected in the nuclei of transfected cells. Evidence is presented that this accumulation of RNA resulted from a failure of transcription termination, leading to multiple rounds of transcription of the circular templates. We conclude that the sequences required for efficient cleavage/polyadenylation of the SV40 early pre-mRNA also constitute an important element of an RNA polymerase II termination signal. A model proposing a mechanism by which the act of pre-mRNA 3' end formation is signaled to the elongating RNA polymerase, resulting in termination, is presented.}

Here we show that the MOF chromobarrel domain is essential for H4K16 acetylation throughout the Drosophila genome and is required for spreading of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex on the X chromosome. The MOF chromobarrel domain directly interacts with nucleic acids and potentiates MOF's enzymatic activity after chromatin binding, making it a unique example of a chromo-like domain directly controlling acetylation activity in vivo. We also show that the Drosophila-specific N terminus of MOF has evolved to perform sex-specific functions. It modulates nucleosome binding and HAT activity and controls MSL complex assembly, thus regulating MOF function in dosage compensation. We propose that MOF has been especially tailored to achieve tight regulation of its enzymatic activity and enable its dual role on X and autosomes. Conrad et al. show that the chromobarrel domain of the histone acetyltransferase MOF directly interacts with nucleic acids and triggers H4K16 acetylation. At the same time, the Drosophila-specific MOF N terminus modulates nucleosome binding and acetyltransferase activity and controls MSL complex assembly, thus regulating MOF function in X-chromosome dosage compensation. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

We focused our analysis on the MSL2-MSL1 interaction, which is postulated to play a critical role in MSL complex association with the X chromosome. Using a modified two-hybrid assay, we isolated missense mutations in MSL2 that disrupt its interaction with MSL1. Eleven out of 12 mutated residues clustered around the first zinc-binding site of the RING finger domain were conserved in a Drosophila virilis MSL2 homolog. Two pre-existing msl2 alleles, which fail to support male viability in vivo, have lesions in the same region of the RING finger. We tested these in the two-hybrid system and found that they are also defective in interaction with MSL1. Mutation of the second zinc-binding site had little effect on MSL1 binding, suggesting that this portion of the RING finger may have a distinct function. Our data support a model in which MSL2-MSL1 interaction nucleates assembly of an MSL complex, with which MLE is weakly or transiently associated.},

Using methods that resolve individual organelles, we studied the origin of oocyte and germ plasm-associated mitochondria during Drosophila oogenesis. Mitochondria partition equally on the spindle during germline stem cell and cystocyte divisions. Subsequently, a fraction of cyst mitochondria and Golgi vesicles associates with the fusome, moves through the ring canals, and enters the oocyte in a large mass that resembles the Balbiani bodies of Xenopus, humans and diverse other species. Some mRNAs, including oskar RNA, specifically associate with the oocyte fusome and a region of the Balbiani body prior to becoming localized. Balbiani body development requires an intact fusome and microtubule cytoskeleton as it is blocked by mutations in hu-li tai shao, while egalitarian mutant follicles accumulate a large mitochondrial aggregate in all 16 cyst cells. Initially, the Balbiani body supplies virtually all the mitochondria of the oocyte, including those used to form germ plasm, because the oocyte ring canals specifically block inward mitochondrial transport until the time of nurse cell dumping. Our findings reveal new similarities between oogenesis in Drosophila and vertebrates, and support our hypothesis that developing oocytes contain specific mechanisms to ensure that germ plasm is endowed with highly functional organelles.},

In gonadal cells, this conserved pathway is crucial for genome defense, and its main function is to silence transposable elements. This is achieved through posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene silencing. Precursors that give rise to piRNAs require specialized transcription and transport machineries because piRNA biogenesis is a cytoplasmic process. The ping-pong cycle, a posttranscriptional silencing mechanism, combines the cleavage-dependent silencing of transposon RNAs with piRNA production. PIWI proteins also function in the nucleus, where they scan for nascent target transcripts with sequence complementarity, instructing transcriptional silencing and deposition of repressive chromatin marks at transposon loci. Although studies have revealed numerous factors that participate in each branch of the piRNA pathway, the precise molecular roles of these factors often remain unclear. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in piRNA biogenesis and function.},

This gradient is derived from translation of the nos mRNA that is localized in the pole plasm; in contrast, unlocalized nos mRNA is translationally repressed. Here we define the essential signals in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of nos mRNA. Deletion of a 184-nucleotide translational control element (TCE) from the 3' UTR leads to the derepression of nos mRNA in the bulk cytoplasm and the development of lethal anterior defects. Furthermore, a minimal mRNA containing essentially only the TCE in its 3' UTR rescues nos- embryos to adulthood. The TCE is also sufficient to confer on maternal torso mRNA all three aspects of nos mRNA regulation: translational repression in the bulk cytoplasm, localization to the pole plasm, and translational activation at the posterior pole. These three phenomena are coupled intimately, as mutations in a pair of CUGGC pentamers within the TCE simultaneously abrogate all three regulatory events. This coupling suggests a model in which the polarized distribution of nos protein is generated primarily by translational control and that nos mRNA localization is a byproduct of this regulation, at least in part.},

Assembly of this complex is initiated by the binding of the transcription factor TFIID, composed of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s), to the promoter. We have now characterized an immunopurified TFIID complex which we unexpectedly find contains the cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), one of the factors required for formation of the 3 end of messenger RNA. CPSF is brought to the preinitiation complex by TFIID, but after transcription starts, CPSF dissociates from TFIID and becomes associated with the elongating polymerase. We also show that overexpression of recombinant TBP in HeLa cells decreases polyadenylation without affecting the correct initiation of transcription of the reporter gene. This indicates that, owing to incomplete assembly of TFIID on recombinant TBP, CPSF is not brought to the promoter and therefore polyadenylation becomes less efficient. Our observations have thus revealed a link between transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II and processing of the 3 end of mRNA.}

We also showed that p62 binds specifically to wheat germ agglutinin. Therefore, we proposed that this nuclear pore complex protein might be a member of a recently characterized family of glycoproteins that are labeled by in vitro galactosylation of rat liver nuclei and contain O-linked monosaccharidic GlcNAc residues. In support of this, we now show that incubation with N-acetylglucosaminidase reduces the molecular mass of p62 by approximately 3 kDa because of the removal of terminal GlcNAc residues. Moreover, p62 can be galactosylated in vitro by using UDP-[3H]galactose and galactosyltransferase. We also show that most of the GlcNAc residues are added within 5 min of synthesis, when p62 is soluble and cytosolic. Thus, the addition of GlcNAc is carried out in the cytoplasm and is clearly distinct from the N- and O-linked glycosylation pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Using another mAb with a broad specificity for nuclear GlcNAc-containing proteins, we show by immunofluorescence and protein blotting of subnuclear fractions that some of these proteins are in the interior of the nucleus, and others are most likely located in the pore complex.},

Here, we show that splicing can also contribute to histone modification, which implies bidirectional communication between epigenetic mechanisms and RNA processing. Genome-wide analysis of histone methylation in human cell lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing genes are preferentially marked with histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) relative to intronless genes. In intron-containing genes, H3K36me3 marking is proportional to transcriptional activity, whereas in intronless genes, H3K36me3 is always detected at much lower levels. Furthermore, splicing inhibition impairs recruitment of H3K36 methyltransferase HYPB (also known as Setd2) and reduces H3K36me3, whereas splicing activation has the opposite effect. Moreover, the increase of H3K36me3 correlates with the length of the first intron, consistent with the view that splicing enhances H3 methylation. We propose that splicing is mechanistically coupled to recruitment of HYPB/Setd2 to elongating RNA polymerase II. \textcopyright{} 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, alpha-spectrin is required for these processes in germline cells, but not in the follicle cells that surround each cyst.

Using immunoblot-based as well as single-cell assay systems, we present evidence that Drosophila glypicans indeed enhance BMP signaling in trans in a contact-dependent manner in vitro. Our analysis showed that heparan sulfate modification is required for the trans co-receptor activity of DALLY. Two BMP-like molecules, Decapentaplegic (DPP) and Glass bottom boat, can mediate trans signaling through a heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptor in S2 cells. The in vitro systems reflect the molecular characteristics of heparan sulfate proteoglycan functions observed previously in vivo, such as ligand specificity and biphasic activity dependent on the ligand dosage. In addition, experiments using a DALLY-coated surface suggested that DALLY regulates DPP signaling in trans by its effect on the stability of DPP protein on the surface of the contacting cells. Our findings provide the molecular foundation for novel contact-dependent signaling, which defines the physical space of the stem cell niche in vivo. \textcopyright{} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

In spite of its biological significance, little is known concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating large-scale chromatin structure in mammalian oocytes. Here, recent findings that provide mechanistic insight into the complex relationship between large-scale chromatin structure and global transcriptional repression in pre-ovulatory oocytes will be discussed. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins such as acetylation and methylation are crucial for heterochromatin formation and thus play a key role in remodeling the oocyte genome. This strategy involves multiple and hierarchical chromatin modifications that regulate nuclear dynamics in response to a developmentally programmed signal(s), presumably of paracrine origin, before the resumption of meiosis. Models for the experimental manipulation of large-scale chromatin structure in vivo and in vitro will be instrumental to determine the key cellular pathways and oocyte-derived factors involved in genome-wide chromatin modifications. Importantly, analysis of the functional differentiation of chromatin structure in the oocyte genome with high resolution and in real time will have wide-ranging implications to understand the role of nuclear organization in meiosis, the events of nuclear reprogramming and the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression during development and differentiation. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Chromatin configuration in the germinal vesicle (GV) undergoes dynamic changes during oocyte growth, yet little is known about the mechanisms regulating chromatin remodeling in mouse oocytes. The hypothesis that companion granulosa cells play a role in modulating chromatin configuration and subsequent transcriptional activity in the oocyte genome was tested. Analysis of transcriptional activity, as determined by Br-UTP incorporation, revealed a similar percentage of transcriptionally active and inactive oocytes present in the large antral follicles of mature females. However, gonadotropin stimulation of follicular development induced an increase in the proportion of transcriptionally inactive oocytes. Interestingly, a similar proportion of stage-matched, oocyte-granulosa cell complexes grown in vitro without gonadotropin stimulation displayed chromatin redistribution around the nucleolus and no transcriptional activity. In contrast, when cultured in the absence of companion granulosa cells, transcriptional activity remained unabated in the majority of denuded GV stage oocytes. Extended prophase arrest in fully grown transcriptionally inactive oocyte-granulosa cell complexes had no effect on the progression of meiosis after in vitro maturation. However, it reduced the competence to complete preimplantation embryo development. These results indicate that chromatin redistribution around the nucleolus is associated with transcriptional repression in the GV of both fully grown in vivo-derived oocytes and cultured oocyte-granulosa cell complexes. Moreover, the results presented here suggest that some aspects of intraovarian control mechanisms were abrogated during culture of oocyte-granulosa cell complexes, resulting in a higher proportion of oocytes with "mature" chromatin. Most importantly, companion granulosa cells played an active role in modulating the transcriptional activity of the oocyte genome. \textcopyright{} 2001 Academic Press.},

The substrate and product specificities of SET domain KMTs are pivotal to eliciting these effects due to the distinct functions associated with site and state-specific protein lysine methylation. Here, we review advances in understanding the molecular basis of these specificities gained through structural and biochemical studies of the human methyltransferases Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 (MLL1, also known as KMT2A) and SET7/9 (KMT7).

We show that Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) provide a powerful system for studying Polycomb silencing. GSCs have a non-canonical distribution of PRC2 activity and lack silenced chromatin like embryonic progenitors. As GSC daughters differentiate into nurse cells and oocytes, nurse cells, like embryonic somatic cells, silence genes in traditional Polycomb domains and in generally inactive chromatin. Developmentally controlled expression of two Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-interacting proteins, Pcl and Scm, initiate silencing during differentiation. In GSCs, abundant Pcl inhibits PRC2-dependent silencing globally, while in nurse cells Pcl declines and newly induced Scm concentrates PRC2 activity on traditional Polycomb domains. Our results suggest that PRC2-dependent silencing is developmentally regulated by accessory proteins that either increase the concentration of PRC2 at target sites or inhibit the rate that PRC2 samples chromatin.},

The H4K16 acetyltransferase males absent on the first (MOF), known to mediate the Drosophila X upregulation, is also enriched on the mammalian X. Depletion of MOF or male-specific lethal 1 (MSL1) in mouse ES cells causes a specific decrease in PolII-S5p and in expression of a subset of X-linked genes. Analyses of RNA half-life data sets show increased stability of mammalian X-linked transcripts. Both ancestral X-linked genes, defined as those conserved on chicken autosomes, and newly acquired X-linked genes are upregulated by similar mechanisms but to a different extent, suggesting that subsets of genes are distinctly regulated depending on their evolutionary history. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.}

These proteins are also components of the fusome, a cytoplasmic structure that spans the cystoblast's progeny that develop to form a germline cyst consisting of 15 nurse cells and an oocyte. Spectrosomes and fusomes are associated with one pole of spindles during mitosis and are implicated in cyst formation and oocyte differentiation. Here we show that the asymmetric behavior of the spectrosome persists throughout the cell cycle of GSC. Eliminating the spectrosome by the hts mutation leads to randomized spindle orientation, suggesting that the spectrosome anchors the spindle to ensure the asymmetry of GSC division; eliminating the fusome in developing cysts results in defective spindles and randomized spindle orientation as well as asynchronous and reduced cystocyte divisions. These observations suggest that fusomes are required for the proper formation and asymmetric orientation of mitotic spindles. Moreover, they reinforce the notion that fusomes are required for the four synchronous divisions of the cystoblast leading to cyst formation. In hts1 cysts which lack fusomes and fail to incorporate a hts gene product(s) into ring canals following cyst formation, polarized microtubule networks do not form, the dynamics of cytoplasmic dynein is disrupted, and oskar and orb RNAs fail to be transported to the future oocyte. These observations support the proposed role of fusomes and ring canals in organizing a polarized microtubule-based transport system for RNA localization that leads to oocyte differentiation.}

The somatic cells within the seminiferous tubules, the Sertoli cells, are able to produce growth factors that stimulate self-renewal (GDNF, FGF2) and differentiation (activin A, BMP4, and SCF) of the SSCs. As Sertoli cells are everywhere on the basal membrane of the tubules, other factors coming from outside the tubules must determine, either directly or indirectly via Sertoli cells, whether in a particular area self-renewal of SSCs will be preferred or differentiation in the form of Apr formation. Self-renewal will be preferred in the stem cell niche and differentiation outside of the niche. Factors that could link the niche to the interstitial tissue are CSF1, produced by Leydig cells that stimulate stem cell proliferation and FSH, the concentration of which will be highest near blood vessels and that stimulates GDNF production by Sertoli cells. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The nature of the recognition of acetyl-lysine by the P/CAF bromodomain is similar to that of acetyl-CoA by histone acetyltransferase.

These mechanisms include upregulation of the heterogametic chromosome as well as repression in the homogametic sex. Remarkably, strategies for dosage compensation differ between species. In organisms where more is known about molecular mechanisms of dosage compensation, specific protein complexes containing noncoding RNAs are targeted to the X chromosome.

The Fokker\&\#150;Planck equation can be transformed to a Schr\&ouml;dinger equation with a potential of the form that occurs in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

The quadrature is based on a set of nonclassical polynomials orthogonal with respect to a weight function determined by the potential function in the Schr\&ouml;dinger equation. For the Fokker\&\#150;Planck operator, the weight function that provides rapid convergence of the eigenvalues are the steady distributions at infinite time, that is, the ground state wave functions. In the present paper, the weight functions used in an analogous solution of the Schr\&ouml;dinger equation are related to the ground state wave functions if known, or some approximate form. Calculations are carried out for a model systems, the Morse potential, and for the vibrational levels of O2 and Ar\&\#150;Xe with realistic pair potentials.

Two competing classes of models have been proposed in which nucleosomes are either arranged linearly in a one-start higher order helix or zigzag back and forth in a two-start helix. We analyzed compacted nucleosome arrays stabilized by introduction of disulfide cross-links and show that the chromatin fiber comprises two stacks of nucleosomes in accord with the two-start model.}

New evidence suggests that the multiprotein nuclear pores also play a role in chromatin organization and gene expression. Given the importance of NPC function, it is not surprising that a growing list of human diseases and developmental defects have been linked to its malfunction. In order to fully understand the functional repertoire of NPCs and their essential role for nuclear organization, it is critical to determine the sequence of events that lead to the formation of nuclear pores. This is particularly relevant since NPC number, and possibly composition, are tightly linked to metabolic activity. Most of our knowledge is derived from NPC formation that occurs in dividing cells at the end of mitosis when the nuclear envelope (NE) and NPCs reform from disassembled precursors. However, NPC assembly also takes place during interphase into an intact NE. Importantly, this process is not restricted to dividing cells but also occurs during cell differentiation. Here, we will review aspects unique to this process, namely the regulation of nuclear expansion and the mechanisms of fusion between the outer and inner nuclear membranes. We will then discuss conserved and diverging mechanisms between post-mitotic and interphase assembly of the proteinaceous structure in light of recently published data.},

We show that phosphorylation occurs rapidly over a large region around DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Histone H4 acetylation is also important for DSB repair, and we found that the NuA4 HAT complex associates specifically with phospho-H2A peptides. A single NuA4 subunit, Arp4, is responsible for the interaction. The NuA4 complex is recruited to a DSB concomitantly with the appearance of H2A P-Ser129 and Arp4 is important for this binding. Arp4 is also a subunit of the Ino80 and Swr1 chromatin remodeling complexes, which also interact with H2A P-Ser129 and are recruited to DSBs. This association again requires Arp4 but also prior NuA4 recruitment and action. Thus, phosphorylation of H2A at DNA damage sites creates a mark recognized by different chromatin modifiers. This interaction leads to stepwise chromatin reconfiguration, allowing efficient DNA repair.}

Its catalytic component, Esa1, is essential for cell cycle progression, gene-specific regulation and has been implicated in DNA repair. Almost all NuA4 subunits have clear homologues in higher eukaryotes, suggesting that the complex is conserved throughout evolution to metazoans. We demonstrate here that NuA4 complexes are indeed present in human cells. Tip60 and its splice variant Tip60b/PLIP were purified as stable HAT complexes associated with identical polypeptides, with 11 of the 12 proteins being homologs of yeast NuA4 subunits. This indicates a highly conserved subunit composition and the identified human proteins underline the role of NuA4 in the control of mammalian cell proliferation. ING3, a member of the ING family of growth regulators, links NuA4 to p53 function which we confirmed in vivo. Proteins specific to the human NuA4 complexes include ruvB-like helicases and a bromodomain-containing subunit linked to ligand-dependent transcription activation by the thyroid hormone receptor. We also demonstrate that subunits MRG15 and DMAP1 are present in distinct protein complexes harboring histone deacetylase and SWI2-related ATPase activities, respectively. Finally, analogous to yeast, a recombinant trimeric complex formed by Tip60, EPC1, and ING3 is sufficient to reconstitute robust nucleosomal HAT activity in vitro. In conclusion, the NuA4 HAT complex is highly conserved in eukaryotes, in which it plays primary roles in transcription, cellular response to DNA damage, and cell cycle control.},

The KDM5 family of transcriptional regulators are histone H3 lysine 4 demethylases that can function through both demethylase-dependent and-independent mechanisms. While loss and overexpression of KDM5 proteins are linked to intellectual disability and cancer, respectively, their normal developmental functions remain less characterized. Drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system to investigate KDM5 function, as it encodes a single ortholog in contrast to the four paralogs found in mammalian cells. To examine the consequences of complete loss of KDM5, we generated a null allele of Drosophila kdm5, also known as little imaginal discs (lid), and show that it is essential for viability. Animals lacking KDM5 show a dramatically delayed larval development that coincides with decreased proliferation and increased cell death in wing imaginal discs. Interestingly, this developmental delay is independent of the well-characterized Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-encoded histone demethylase activity of KDM5, suggesting key functions for less characterized domains. Consistent with the phenotypes observed, transcriptome analyses of kdm5 null mutant wing imaginal discs revealed the dysregulation of genes involved in several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Together, our analyses reveal KDM5 as a key regulator of larval growth and offer an invaluable tool for defining the biological activities of KDM5 family proteins.},

In Drosophila germ cells, compromised NL integrity activates the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) checkpoint kinases, blocking germ cell differentiation and causing germline stem cell (GSC) loss. Checkpoint activation occurs upon loss of either the NL protein emerin or its partner barrier-to-autointegration factor, two proteins required for nuclear reassembly at the end of mitosis. Here, we examined how mitosis contributes to NL structural defects linked to checkpoint activation. These analyses led to the unexpected discovery that wild-type female GSCs utilize a non-canonical mode of mitosis, one that retains a permeable but intact nuclear envelope and NL. We show that the interphase NL is remodeled during mitosis for insertion of centrosomes that nucleate the mitotic spindle within the confines of the nucleus. We show that depletion or loss of NL components causes mitotic defects, including compromised chromosome segregation associated with altered centrosome positioning and structure. Further, in emerin mutant GSCs, centrosomes remain embedded in the interphase NL. Notably, these embedded centrosomes carry large amounts of pericentriolar material and nucleate astral microtubules, revealing a role for emerin in the regulation of centrosome structure. Epistasis studies demonstrate that defects in centrosome structure are upstream of checkpoint activation, suggesting that these centrosome defects might trigger checkpoint activation and GSC loss. Connections between NL proteins and centrosome function have implications for mechanisms associated with NL dysfunction in other stem cell populations, including NL-associated diseases, such as laminopathies.},

Previous studies have established that TFIIH enters the preinitiation complex and fulfills a critical role in initiation by catalyzing ATP-dependent formation of the open complex prior to synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts. In this report, we present direct evidence that TFIIH also controls RNA polymerase II activity at a postinitiation stage of transcription, by preventing premature arrest by very early elongation complexes just prior to their transition to stably elongating complexes. Unexpectedly, we observe that TFIIH is capable of entering the transcription cycle not only during assembly of the preinitiation complex but also after initiation and synthesis of as many as four to six phosphodiester bonds. These findings shed new light on the role of TFIIH in initiation and promoter escape and reveal an unanticipated flexibility in the ability of TFIIH to interact with RNA polymerase II transcription intermediates prior to, during, and immediately after initiation.}

In order to understand the principle by which ACF1 improves the efficiency of ISWI, we mapped their mutual interaction requirements and generated a series of ACF complexes lacking conserved ACF1 domains. Deletion of the C-terminal PHD finger modules of ACF1 or their disruption by zinc chelation profoundly affected the nucleosome mobilization capability of associated ISWI in trans. Interactions of the PHD fingers with the central domains of core histones contribute significantly to the binding of ACF to the nucleosome substrate, suggesting a novel role for PHD modules as nucleosome interaction determinants.

The female germline is created during embryogenesis when the precursors of primordial germ cells differentiate from somatic lineages of the embryo and take a unique route to reach the urogenital ridge. This undifferentiated gonad will differentiate along a female pathway, and the newly formed oocytes will proliferate and subsequently enter meiosis. At this point, the oocyte has two alternative fates: die, a common destiny of millions of oocytes, or be fertilized, a fate of at most approximately 100 oocytes, depending on the species. At every step from germline development and ovary formation to oogenesis and ovarian development and differentiation, there are coordinated interactions of hundreds of proteins and small RNAs. These studies have helped reproductive biologists to understand not only the normal functioning of the ovary but also the pathophysiology and genetics of diseases such as infertility and ovarian cancer. Over the last two decades, parallel progress has been made in the assisted reproductive technology clinic including better hormonal preparations, prenatal genetic testing, and optimal oocyte and embryo analysis and cryopreservation. Clearly, we have learned much about the mammalian ovary and manipulating its most important cargo, the oocyte, since the birth of Louise Brown over 30 yr ago.}

We have therefore investigated whether these two elements, individually or in combination, can prevent transcriptional interference of RNA polymerase II-activated promoters. For this purpose, we constructed an expression plasmid containing two tandem retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) derived from HIV-1. When transfected into HeLa cells, this construct resulted in transcriptional interference of the LTR promoters. Using this assay, we were able to show that a single poly(A) signal was able to protect an otherwise occluded promoter. This effect depended on the RNA-processing strength of the poly(A) signal. Furthermore, transcriptional pause sites provided adequate protection against promoter occlusion even when tested alone. Finally, a combined element consisting of a poly(A) signal followed by a pause site was more efficient in promoter protection than either element on its own. These results indicate that an interference-blocking element can take various forms: a poly(A) signal, a transcriptional pause site or a combination of both.},

During egg activation, relative changes in poly(A)-tail length, and thus translational efficiency, were largely retained in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies these changes. Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and these changes were largely attributable to tail-length changes. Our results also revealed the presence of tail-length-independent mechanisms that maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented essentially all translation of bicoid and several other mRNAs before egg activation. In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies.},

Recent studies have given novel insight into the spatiotemporal regulation and molecular mechanisms controlling abscission in cultured yeast and human cells. The mechanisms of abscission in living metazoan tissues are however not well understood. Here we show that ALIX and the ESCRT-III component Shrub are required for completion of abscission during Drosophila female germline stem cell (fGSC) division. Loss of ALIX or Shrub function in fGSCs leads to delayed abscission and the consequent formation of stem cysts in which chains of daughter cells remain interconnected to the fGSC via midbody rings and fusome. We demonstrate that ALIX and Shrub interact and that they co-localize at midbody rings and midbodies during cytokinetic abscission in fGSCs. Mechanistically, we show that the direct interaction between ALIX and Shrub is required to ensure cytokinesis completion with normal kinetics in fGSCs. We conclude that ALIX and ESCRT-III coordinately control abscission in Drosophila fGSCs and that their complex formation is required for accurate abscission timing in GSCs in vivo.}

Previous work has suggested that organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional adaptation, a process by which related gene(s) are upregulated independently of protein feedback loops. However, the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, by analysing several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse, we uncover a requirement for mutant mRNA degradation. Alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional adaptation, and these alleles give rise to more severe phenotypes than alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay reveals the upregulation of a substantial proportion of the genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene's mRNA, suggesting a sequence-dependent mechanism. These findings have implications for our understanding of disease-causing mutations, and will help in the design of mutant alleles with minimal transcriptional adaptation-derived compensation.}

NE breakdown (NEBD) marks a highly regulated switch in chromosome confinement by membranes in interphase to microtubules in M-phase. The boundary of interphase nuclei has a rigid and highly interconnected architecture made up of a concentric double membrane with embedded nuclear pores, underlying intermediate filaments and the connected chromosome territories. Upon entering mitosis, cells completely and rapidly dismantle the connections between these structures to allow chromosomes to condense and be captured by the mitotic spindle which then accurately partitions them to daughter cells. Once segregation is accomplished, the complex interphase architecture is quickly re-established to enable essential functions such as transcription and replication to start anew. Several excellent recent reviews have touched upon this subject from several angles.1-6 In this Chapter, I intend to present a global picture of the dynamics of nuclear envelope proteins during mitosis in mammalian cells and also touch upon other cellular structures important for nuclear envelope remodeling including chromosomes and the mitotic spindle.},

The GAL4 system relies on two components: (1) GAL4, a transcriptional activator from yeast, which is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and (2) a transgene under the control of the upstream activation sequence that is bound by GAL4 (UASG). The two components are brought together in a simple genetic cross. In the progeny of the cross, the transgene is only transcribed in those cells or tissues expressing the GAL4 protein. Recent modifications of the GAL4 system have improved the control of both the initiation and the spatial restriction of transgene expression. Here we describe the GAL4 system highlighting the properties that make it a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function in Drosophila and higher organisms.}

This pathway requires Nxf3-Nxt1, a variant of the hetero-dimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1. Nxf3 interacts with UAP56, a nuclear RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, and CG13741/Bootlegger, which recruits Nxf3-Nxt1 and UAP56 to heterochromatic piRNA source loci. Upon RNA cargo binding, Nxf3 achieves nuclear export via the exportin Crm1 and accumulates together with Bootlegger in peri-nuclear nuage, suggesting that after export, Nxf3-Bootlegger delivers precursor transcripts to the piRNA processing sites. These findings indicate that the piRNA pathway bypasses nuclear RNA surveillance systems to export unprocessed transcripts to the cytoplasm, a strategy also exploited by retroviruses.},

Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis. \textcopyright{} 2007, SAGE Publications.

The process involves four pivotal transitions occurring in physical proximity: spermatogonial differentiation, meiotic initiation, initiation of spermatid elongation, and release of spermatozoa. We report how the four transitions are coordinated in mice. Two premeiotic transitions, spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation, were known to be coregulated by an extrinsic signal, retinoic acid (RA). Our chemical manipulations of RA levels in mouse testes now reveal that RA also regulates the two postmeiotic transitions: initiation of spermatid elongation and spermatozoa release. We measured RA concentrations and found that they changed periodically, as also reflected in the expression patterns of an RA-responsive gene, STRA8; RA levels were low before the four transitions, increased when the transitions occurred, and remained elevated thereafter. We found that pachytene spermatocytes, which express an RA-synthesizing enzyme, Aldh1a2, contribute directly and significantly to RA production in testes. Indeed, chemical and genetic depletion of pachytene spermatocytes revealed that RA from pachytene spermatocytes was required for the two postmeiotic transitions, but not for the two premeiotic transitions. We conclude that the premeiotic transitions are coordinated by RA from Sertoli (somatic) cells. Once germ cells enter meiosis, pachytene spermatocytes produce RA to coordinate the two postmeiotic transitions. In combination, these elements underpin the spatiotemporal coordination of spermatogenesis and ensure its prodigious output in adult males.},

Elevated gene expression from the two X chromosomes of female embryos is proposed to facilitate the stable establishment of Sex-lethal (Sxl) expression, which determines sex and represses further activity of the MSL complex, leaving it active only in males. Important supporting data included female-lethal genetic interactions between the seven msl genes and either Sxl or scute and sisterlessA, two of the X-signal elements (XSE) that regulate early Sxl expression. Here I report contrary findings that there are no female-lethal genetic interactions between the msl genes and Sxl or its XSE regulators. Fly stocks containing the msl31 allele were found to exhibit a maternal-effect interaction with Sxl, scute, and sisterlessA mutations, but genetic complementation experiments showed that msl3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the female-lethal interactions, which appear to be due to an unidentified maternal regulator of Sxl. Published data cited as evidence for an early function of the MSL complex in females, including a maternal effect of msl2, have been reevaluated and found not to support a maternal, or other effect, of the MSL complex in sex determination. These findings suggest that the MSL complex is not involved in primary sex determination or in X chromosome dosage compensation prior to the maternal-to-zygotic transition.},

These proteins bind in close proximity to the catalytic SET domain of SET1-family enzymes and stimulate H3K4 methyltransferase activity.

Previous studies suggested that Egg is post-translationally modified and showed that Windei (Wde) regulates Egg nuclear localization through protein?protein interaction. Monoubiquitination of mammalian SETDB1 is necessary for the HMT activity. Here, using cultured ovarian somatic cells, we show that Egg is monoubiquitinated and phosphorylated but that only monoubiquitination is required for piRNA-mediated transposon repression. Egg monoubiquitination occurs in the nucleus. Egg has its own nuclear localization signal, and the nuclear import of Egg is Wde-independent. Wde recruits Egg to the chromatin at target gene silencing loci, but their interaction is monoubiquitin-independent. The abundance of nuclear Egg is governed by that of nuclear Wde. These results illuminate essential roles of nuclear monoubiquitination of Egg and the role of Wde in piRNA-mediated transposon repression.},

It delayed meiotic resumption, altered the dynamics of chromatin condensation, and impaired kinetochore-spindle interactions, bipolar spindle organization and chromosome segregation in more mature oocytes. The observed phenotypes related to changes in abundance of specific transcripts in mutant oocytes. Setdb1 maternally deficient embryos arrested during pre-implantation development and showed comparable defects during cell cycle progression and in chromosome segregation.

The principles that allow the DCC to distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes are not understood. Targeting presumably involves DNA sequence elements whose combination or enrichment mark the X chromosome. DNA sequences that characterize 'chromosomal entry sites' or 'high-affinity sites' may serve such a function. However, to date no DNA binding domain that could interpret sequence information has been identified within the subunits of the DCC. Early genetic studies suggested that MSL1 and MSL2 serve to recognize high-affinity sites (HAS) in vivo, but a direct interaction of these DCC subunits with DNA has not been studied. We now show that recombinant MSL2, through its CXC domain, directly binds DNA with low nanomolar affinity. The DNA binding of MSL2 or of an MSL2-MSL1 complex does not discriminate between different sequences in vitro, but in a reporter gene assay in vivo, suggesting the existence of an unknown selectivity cofactor. Reporter gene assays and localization of GFP-fusion proteins confirm the important contribution of the CXC domain for DCC targeting in vivo. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.

Do the apparent differences in stem cells and spermatogenic lineage development between rodents and primates represent true biological differences or simply differences in the volume of research and the vocabulary that has developed over the past half century? This review will provide an overview of stem, progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia that support spermatogenesis; identifying parallels between rodents and primates where they exist as well as features unique to higher primates.},

The determinants that target NSL to specific promoters and the circumstances in which the complex engages in regulating transcription are currently unknown. Here, we show that the NSL complex primarily targets active promoters and in particular housekeeping genes, at which it colocalizes with the chromatin remodeler NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) and the histone methyltransferase Trithorax. However, only a subset of housekeeping genes associated with NSL are actually activated by it. Our analyses reveal that these NSL-activated promoters are depleted of certain insulator binding proteins and are enriched for the core promoter motif 'Ohler 5'. Based on these results, it is possible to predict whether the NSL complex is likely to regulate a particular promoter. We conclude that the regulatory capacity of the NSL complex is highly context-dependent. Activation by the NSL complex requires a particular promoter architecture defined by combinations of chromatin regulators and core promoter motifs. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).}

Similar to acetylation, histone methylation has emerged as an important player in regulating chromatin dynamics and gene activity [2-4]. Histone methylation occurs on arginine and lysine residues and is catalyzed by two families of proteins, the protein arginine methyltransferase family and the SET-domain-containing methyltransferase family [3]. Here, we report that lysine 79 (K79) of H3, located in the globular domain, can be methylated. K79 methylation occurs in a variety of organisms ranging from yeast to human. In budding yeast, K79 methylation is mediated by the silencing protein DOT1. Consistent with conservation of K79 methylation, DOT1 homologs can be found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. We identified a human DOT1-like (DOT1L) protein and demonstrated that this protein possesses intrinsic H3-K79-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that K79 methylation level is regulated throughout the cell cycle. Thus, our studies reveal a new methylation site and define a novel family of histone lysine methyltransferase.},

We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, tran-scription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact-SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection. \textcopyright{} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

In Drosophila melanogaster, roX1 and roX2 are long non-coding RNAs that together with proteins form the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which coats the entire male X-chromosome and mediates dosage compensation by increasing its transcriptional output. Studies on polytene chromosomes have demonstrated that when both roX1 and roX2 are absent, the MSL-complex becomes less abundant on the male X-chromosome and is relocated to the chromocenter and the 4thchromosome. Here we address the role of roX RNAs in MSL-complex targeting and the evolution of dosage compensation in Drosophila. We performed ChIP-seq experiments which showed that MSL-complex recruitment to high affinity sites (HAS) on the X-chromosome is independent of roX and that the HAS sequence motif is conserved in D. simulans. Additionally, a complete and enzymatically active MSL-complex is recruited to six specific genes on the 4thchromosome. Interestingly, our sequence analysis showed that in the absence of roX RNAs, the MSL-complex has an affinity for regions enriched in Hoppel transposable elements and repeats in general. We hypothesize that roX mutants reveal the ancient targeting of the MSL-complex and propose that the role of roX RNAs is to prevent the binding of the MSL-complex to heterochromatin.}

We identify a repressive chromatin type that covers about half of the genome and lacks classic heterochromatin markers. Furthermore, transcriptionally active euchromatin consists of two types that differ in molecular organization and H3K36 methylation and regulate distinct classes of genes. Finally, we provide evidence that the different chromatin types help to target DNA-binding factors to specific genomic regions.

This is likely due to the deregulated expression of genes controlling the switch between spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation. Here we show that Plzf directly represses the transcription of kit, a hallmark of spermatogonial differentiation. Plzf represses both endogenous kit expression and expression of a reporter gene under the control of the kit promoter region. A discrete sequence of the kit promoter, required for Plzf-mediated kit transcriptional repression, is bound by Plzf both in vivo and in vitro. A 3-bp mutation in this Plzf binding site abolishes the responsiveness of the kit promoter to Plzf repression. A significant increase in kit expression is also found in the undifferentiated spermatogonia isolated from Plzf(-/-) mice. Thus, we suggest that one mechanism by which Plzf maintains the pool of spermatogonial stem cells is through a direct repression of kit expression.}

Molecular analysis indicates that the mutant is defective in the conserved kinase nucleosomal histone kinase-1 (NHK-1). Isolation of further alleles and RNA interference in S2 cells demonstrated that NHK-1 is also required for mitotic progression. NHK-1 itself is phosphorylated in mitosis and female meiosis, suggesting that this kinase is part of the regulatory system coordinating progression of mitosis and meiosis. \textcopyright{} The Rockefeller University Press.}

Our results show that marks for both active and non-active chromatin associate differentially with NPCs. The incidence of heterochromatin marks, such as H3K27me2 and H3K9me2, was significantly lower around NPCs. In contrast, the presence of marks of active chromatin such as H3K4me2 was only decreased very slightly around the NPCs or not at all (H3K9Ac). Interestingly, the histone demethylases LSD1 (also known as KDM1A) and KDM2A were enriched within the NPCs, suggesting that there was a chromatin-modifying mechanism at the NPCs. Inhibition of transcription resulted in a larger drop in the distribution of H1, H3K9me2 and H3K23me2, which implies that transcription has a role in the organization of heterochromatin at the NP.},

We have determined the non-random distribution of DNA sequences relative to the transcriptional start site in Drosophila melanogaster promoters to identify sequences that may be biologically significant. We compare these results with those obtained for human promoters. Results: We determined the distribution of all 65,536 octamer (8-mers) DNA sequences in 10,914 Drosophila promoters and two sets of human promoters aligned relative to the transcriptional start site. In Drosophila, 298 8-mers have highly significant (p {$\leq$} I \texttimes{} 10-16) non-random distributions peaking within 100 base-pairs of the transcriptional start site. These sequences were grouped into 15 DNA motifs. Ten motifs, termed directional motifs, occur only on the positive strand while the remaining five motifs, termed non-directional motifs, occur on both strands. The only directional motifs to localize in human promoters are TATA, INR, and DPE. The directional motifs were further subdivided into those precisely positioned relative to the transcriptional start site and those that are positioned more loosely relative to the transcriptional start site. Similar numbers of non-directional motifs were identified in both species and most are different. The genes associated with all 15 DNA motifs, when they occur in the peak are enriched in specific Gene Ontology categories and show a distinct mRNA expression pattern, suggesting that there is a core promoter code in Drosophila. Conclusion: Drosophila and human promoters use different DNA sequences to regulate gene expression, supporting the idea that evolution occurs by the modulation of gene regulation. \textcopyright{} 2006 FitzGerald et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017. During Drosophila oogenesis, germline stem cells (GSCs) self-renew and differentiate to give rise to a mature egg. Self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs are regulated by both intrinsic mechanisms such as regulation of gene expression in the germ line and extrinsic signaling pathways from the surrounding somatic niche. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone-modifying proteins, nucleosome remodeling complexes, and histone variants, play a critical role in regulating intrinsic gene expression and extrinsic signaling cues from the somatic niche. In the GSCs, intrinsic epigenetic modifiers are required to maintain a stem cell fate by promoting expression of self-renewal factors and repressing the differentiation program. Subsequently, in the GSC daughters, epigenetic regulators activate the differentiation program to promote GSC differentiation. During differentiation, the GSC daughter undergoes meiosis to give rise to the developing egg, containing a compacted chromatin architecture called the karyosome. Epigenetic modifiers control the attachment of chromosomes to the nuclear lamina to aid in meiotic recombination and the release from the lamina for karyosome formation. The germ line is in close contact with the soma for the entirety of this developmental process. This proximity facilitates signaling from the somatic niche to the developing germ line. Epigenetic modifiers play a critical role in the somatic niche, modulating signaling pathways in order to coordinate the transition of GSC to an egg. Together, intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic mechanisms modulate this exquisitely balanced program.}

Pgc is expressed transiently in the immediate GSC daughter (pre-cystoblast), where it mediates a pulse of transcriptional silencing.

Pgc mediated accumulation of CycB is also required for heterochromatin deposition, which protects the germ line genome against selfish DNA elements.

  abstract = {The zinc-finger protein Nanos and the RNA-binding protein Pumilio act together to repress the translation of maternal hunchback RNA in the posterior of the Drosophila embryo, thereby allowing abdomen formation. nanos RNA is localized to the posterior pole during oogenesis and the posteriorly synthesized Nanos protein is sequestered into the germ cells as they form in the embryo. This maternally provided Nanos protein is present in germ cells throughout embryogenesis. Here we show that maternally deposited Nanos protein is essential for germ cell migration. Lack of zygotic activity of nanos and pumilio has a dramatic effect on germline development of homozygous females. Given the coordinate function of nanos and pumilio in embryonic patterning, we analyzed the role of these genes in oogenesis. We find that both genes act in the germline. Although the nanos and pumilio ovarian phenotypes have similarities and both genes ultimately affect germline stem cell development, the focus of these phenotypes appears to be different. While pumilio mutant ovaries fail to maintain stem cells and all germline cells differentiate into egg chambers, the focus of nanos function seems to lie in the differentiation of the stem cell progeny, the cystoblast. Consistent with the model that nanos and pumilio have different phenotypic foci during oogenesis, we detect high levels of Pumilio protein in the germline stem cells and high levels of Nanos in the dividing cystoblasts. We therefore suggest that, in contrast to embryonic patterning, Nanos and Pumilio may interact with different partners in the germline.},

Cre recombinase is known to have possible toxic effects that can compromise normal cell cycle and survival. Here we show, by using three independent nestin Cre transgenic lines, that high levels of Cre recombinase expression into the nucleus of neuronal progenitors can compromise normal brain development. The transgenics analyzed are the nestin Cre Balancer (Bal1) line, expressing the Cre recombinase with a nuclear localization signal, and two nestin CreER T2 (Cre recombinase fused with a truncated estrogen receptor) mice lines with different levels of expression of a hybrid CreER T2 recombinase that translocates into the nucleus after tamoxifen treatment. All homozygous Bal1 nestin Cre embryos displayed reduced neuronal proliferation, increased aneuploidy and cell death, as well as defects in ependymal lining and lamination of the cortex, leading to microencephaly and to a form of communicating hydrocephalus. An essentially overlapping phenotype was observed in the two nestin CreER T2 transgenic lines after tamoxifen mediated-CreER T2 translocation into the nucleus. Neither tamoxifen-treated wild-type nor nestin CreER T2 oil-treated control mice displayed these defects. These results indicate that some forms of hydrocephalus may derive from a defect in neuronal precursors proliferation. Further-more, they underscore the potential risks for developmental studies of high levels of nuclear Cre in neurogenic cells.}

In gld-1 (null) hermaphrodites, oogenesis is abolished and a germline tumor forms where oocyte development would normally occur. By contrast, gld-1 (null) males are unaffected. The hermaphrodite germline tumor appears to derive from germ cells that enter the meiotic pathway normally but then exit pachytene and return to the mitotic cycle. Certain gld-1 partial loss-of-function mutations also abolish oogenesis, but germ cells arrest in pachytene rather than returning to mitosis. Our results indicate that gld-1 is a tumor suppressor gene required for oocyte development. The tumorous phenotype suggests that gld-1(+) may function to negatively regulate proliferation during meiotic prophase and/or act to direct progression through meiotic prophase. We also show that gld- 1(+) has an additional nonessential role in germline sex determination: promotion of hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. This function of gld-1 is inferred from a haplo-insufficient phenotype and from the properties of gain- of-function gld-1 mutations that cause alterations in the sexual identity of germ cells.},

  abstract = {Only a small percentage of human transcription factors (e.g. those associated with a specific differentiation program) are expressed in a given cell type. Thus, cell fate is mainly determined by cell type-specific silencing of transcription factors that drive different cellular lineages. Several histone modifications have been associated with gene silencing, including H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. We have previously shown that genes for the two largest classes of mammalian transcription factors are marked by distinct histone modifications; homeobox genes are marked by H3K27me3 and zinc finger genes are marked by H3K9me3. Several histone methyltransferases (e.g. G9a and SETDB1) may be involved in mediating the H3K9me3 silencing mark. We have used ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq to demonstrate that SETDB1, but not G9a, is associated with regions of the genome enriched for H3K9me3. One current model is that SETDB1 is recruited to specific genomic locations via interaction with the corepressor TRIM28 (KAP1), which is in turn recruited to the genome via interaction with zinc finger transcription factors that contain a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. However, specific KRAB-ZNFs that recruit TRIM28 (KAP1) and SETDB1 to the genome have not been identified. We now show that ZNF274 (a KRAB-ZNF that contains 5 C2H2 zinc finger domains), can interact with KAP1 both in vivo and in vitro and, using ChIP-seq, we show that ZNF274 binding sites co-localize with SETDB1, KAP1, and H3K9me3 at the 3{${'}$} ends of zinc finger genes. Knockdown of ZNF274 with siRNAs reduced the levels of KAP1 and SETDB1 recruitment to the binding sites. These studies provide the first identification of a KRAB domain-containing ZNF that is involved in recruitment of the KAP1 and SETDB1 to specific regions of the human genome.},

However, because nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA is also used for de novo synthesis of fatty acids, histone acetylation and synthesis of fatty acids compete for the same acetyl-CoA pool. The first and rate-limiting reaction in de novo synthesis of fatty acids is carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is encoded by the ACC1 gene. In this study, we show that attenuated expression of ACC1 results in increased acetylation of bulk histones, globally increased acetylation of chromatin histones, and altered transcriptional regulation. Together, our data indicate that Acc1p activity regulates the availability of acetyl-CoA for histone acetyltransferases, thus representing a link between intermediary metabolism and epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. \textcopyright{} 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

In particular, we highlight the interplay between histone marks in specifying the `next step' of transcription. While many studies have described correlative relationships between histone marks and their occupancy at distinct gene regions, we focus on studies that elucidate clear functional consequences of specific histone marks during different stages of transcription. These recent discoveries have refined our current mechanistic understanding of how histone marks promote Pol II transcriptional progression. Histone tails are extensively post-translationally modified (`marked') by the balance of writers and erasers. Genome-wide localization of histone marks occurs at distinct genic regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers, or gene bodies), often correlating with different functional impacts on Pol II transcription. Different histone marks recruit specific readers important for each stage of the Pol II transcription cycle (H3K4me3/TFIID for initiation, H3K9ac/SEC for pause release, H3K36me3/DNMT3a/b for elongation, and H3K9me2/HP1{$\gamma$} for termination).

However, the fact that nearly one-quarter of patients harbour a variety of mutations in RPS19, a ribosomal protein gene, provides an opportunity to examine whether haplo-insufficiency of RPS19 protein can be demonstrated in certain cases. To that end, we identified 19 of 81 DBA index cases, both familial and sporadic, with RPS19 mutations. We found 14 distinct insertions, deletions, missense, nonsense and splice site mutations in the 19 probands, and studied mutations in 10 patients at the RNA level and in three patients at the protein level. Characterization of the mutations in 10 probands, including six with novel insertions, nonsense and splice site mutations, showed that the abnormal transcript was detectable in nine cases. The RPS19 mRNA and protein in CD34+ bone marrow cells identified haplo-insufficiency in three cases predicted to have one functional allele. Our data support the notion that, in addition to rare DBA patients with the deletion of one allele, the disease in certain other RPS19 mutant patients is because of RPS19 protein haplo-insufficiency.},

Here we find that almost all active genes on the X chromosome are associated with robust H4 Lys16 acetylation (H4K16ac), the histone modification catalyzed by the MSL complex. The distribution of H4K16ac is much broader than that of the MSL complex, and our results favor the idea that chromosome-wide H4K16ac reflects transient association of the MSL complex, occurring through spreading or chromosomal looping. Our results parallel those of localized Polycomb repressive complex and its more broadly distributed chromatin mark, trimethylated histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27me3), suggesting a common principle for the establishment of active and silenced chromatin domains. \textcopyright{} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

Upon ageing, this phenomenon yields seminiferous tubules containing only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. Altogether, our findings indicate that RARG cell-autonomously transduces, in undifferentiated spermatogonia of adult testes, a RA signal critical for spermatogenesis. During the prepubertal spermatogenic wave, the loss of RARG function can however be compensated by RARA, as indicated by the normal timing of appearance of meiotic cells in Rarg-null testes. Accordingly, RARG- and RARA-selective agonists are both able to stimulate Stra8 expression in wild-type prepubertal testes. Interestingly, inactivation of Rarg does not impair expression of the spermatogonia differentiation markers Kit and Stra8, contrary to vitamin A deficiency. This latter observation supports the notion that the RA-signaling pathway previously shown to operate in Sertoli cells also participates in spermatogonia differentiation.

  abstract = {The ribosome has recently transitioned from being viewed as a passive, indiscriminate machine to a more dynamic macromolecular complex with specialized roles in the cell. Here, we discuss the historical milestones from the discovery of the ribosome itself to how this ancient machinery has gained newfound appreciation as a more regulatory participant in the central dogma of gene expression. The first emerging examples of direct changes in ribosome composition at the RNA and protein level, coupled with an increased awareness of the role individual ribosomal components play in the translation of specific mRNAs, is opening a new field of study centered on ribosome-mediated control of gene regulation. In this Perspective, we discuss our current understanding of the known functions for ribosome heterogeneity, including specialized translation of individual transcripts, and its implications for the regulation and expression of key gene regulatory networks. In addition, we suggest what the crucial next steps are to ascertain the extent of ribosome heterogeneity and specialization and its importance for regulation of the proteome within subcellular space, across different cell types, and during multi-cellular organismal development. The ribosome is an ancient macromolecular machine that is universally responsible for synthesizing all proteins within a cell. Genuth and Barna review the evidence for variation in the composition of the ribosome and discuss the potential for different types of ribosomes to be specialized for the production of specific proteins.},

We suppose that specific scenarios of transcription initiation are essentially related to various particular implementations of the interaction of basal transcription machinery with promoter DNA, depending on the presence and mutual positioning of core promoter elements. Results: In addition to the combinations of core promoter elements previously experimentally confirmed [TATA box and Initiator (Inr), Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) and Inr, and TFIIB recognition element (BRE) and TATA box] we propose other alternate synergetic combinations: BRE and Inr, BRE and DPE, and TATA and DPE with respective models. The suggestion is based on a high statistical significance of the alternate combinations in promoters, comparable with the significance of the known combinations. We also present arguments that the BRE element is statistically more important than previously thought, and suggest possible mechanisms of action of the core elements in the promoters with multiple transcription start sites. \textcopyright{} The Author 2004.

Ribosomes, the molecular machines behind translation, were once considered to be an invariant driving force behind protein expression. However, studies over the past decade paint a rather different picture; namely, that ribosomes constitute an additional layer of regulatory control that might define which subsets of mRNAs are translated, to what extent, and to what purpose. Recent works summarized herein directly implicate ribosome heterogeneity and, in particular, ribosomal protein (RP) paralog specificity in regulating mRNA translation and control of the cellular translatome.},

During mitotic cell divisions, sister chromatids separate from each other to opposite poles, resulting in two daughter cells that each have a complete copy of the genome. Meiosis poses a special problem in which homologous chromosomes must first pair and then separate at the first meiotic division before sister chromatids separate at the second meiotic division. So, chromosome interactions between homologues are a unique feature of meiosis and are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Pairing and locking together of homologous chromosomes involves recombination interactions in some cases, but not in others. Although all organisms must match and lock homologous chromosomes to maintain genome integrity throughout meiosis, recent results indicate that the underlying mechanisms vary in different organisms.}

These defects result from a failure to accumulate Gurken protein, which is required to initiate dorsoventral patterning during oogenesis. Here we find that the block in Gurken accumulation in the oocyte cytoplasm reflects activation of a meiotic checkpoint in response to the persistence of DSBs in the nucleus. We also show that Vasa is a target of this meiotic checkpoint, and so may mediate the checkpoint-dependent translational regulation of Gurken.}

Hypomorphic mutant alleles of Nup154 affected female and male fertility, allowing investigation of the gene function in various steps of oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Nup154 was required in testes for cyst formation, control of spermatocyte proliferation and meiotic progression. In ovaries, Nup154 was essential for egg chamber development and oocyte growth. In both the male and female germ line, as well as in several other cell types, the Nup154 protein was detected at the nuclear membrane, but was also present inside the nucleus. Intranuclear localization has not previously been described for rat Nup155 or yeast Nup170 and Nup157. In mutant egg chambers the Nup154 protein accumulated in the cytoplasm, while it was only barely detected at the nuclear envelopes. FG repeats containing nucleoporins detected with mAb414 antibody were also mislocalized to a certain extent in Nup154 mutant alleles. This suggests that Nup154 could be required for localizing other nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex, as previously demonstrated for the yeast Nup170. On the other hand, no evident defects in lamin localization were observed, indicating that Nup155 mutations did not affect the overall integrity of the nuclear envelope. However, ultrastructural analyses revealed that in mutant cells the morphology of the nuclear envelope was altered near the nuclear pore complexes. Finally, the multiplicity of phenotypes observed in Nup154 mutant alleles suggests that this gene plays a crucial role in cell physiology.},

We have shown that two of these genes code for enzymes responsible for specific steps in the synthesis of ecdysone, a polyhydroxylated sterol that is the precursor of the major molting hormone of all arthropods, 20-hydroxyecdysone. These two mitochondrial P450 enzymes, coded for by disembodied (dib) (CYP302A1) and shadow (sad) (CYP315A1), are the C22 and C2 hydroxylases, respectively, as shown by transfection of the gene into S2 cells and subsequent biochemical analysis. These are the last two enzymes in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. A third enzyme, necessary for the critical conversion of ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone, the 20-monooxygenase, is encoded by shade (shd) (CYP314A1). All three enzymes are mitochondrial although shade has motifs suggesting both mitochondrial and microsomal locations. By tagging these enzymes, their subcellular location has been confirmed by confocal microscopy. Shade is present in several tissues as expected while disembodied and shadow are restricted to the ring gland. The paradigm used should allow us to define the enzymes mediating the entire ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

During larval stages, PGCs proliferate in the female gonad, and a subset of PGCs are selected at late larval stages to become germ line stem cells (GSCs), the source of continuous egg production throughout adulthood. However, the degree of similarity between PGCs and the self-renewing GSCs is unclear. Here we show that many of the genes that are required for GSC maintenance in adults are also required to prevent precocious differentiation of PGCs within the larval ovary. We show that following overexpression of the GSC-differentiation gene bag of marbles (bam), PGCs differentiate to form cysts without becoming GSCs. Furthermore, PGCs that are mutant for nanos (nos), pumilio (pum) or for signaling components of the decapentaplegic (dpp) pathway also differentiate. The similarity in the genes necessary for GSC maintenance and the repression of PGC differentiation suggest that PGCs and GSCs may be functionally equivalent and that the larval gonad functions as a "PGC niche".},

However, little is known about how these organs sense that equilibrium is breached, and how they cease changing when homeostasis is reached. Similarly, it remains unclear how, during normal development, different cell types within an organ coordinate their growth. Here we show that during gonad development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster the proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and survival of the somatic intermingled cells (ICs) that contact them are coordinated by means of a feedback mechanism composed of a positive signal and a negative signal. PGCs express the EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand Spitz, which is required for IC survival. In turn, ICs inhibit PGC proliferation. Thus, homeostasis and coordination of growth between soma and germ line in the larval ovary is achieved by using a sensor of PGC numbers (EGFR-mediated survival of ICs) coupled to a correction mechanism inhibiting PGC proliferation. This feedback loop ensures that sufficient numbers of PGCs exist to fill all the stem-cell niches that form at the end of larval development. We propose that similar feedback mechanisms might be generally used for coordinated growth, regeneration and homeostasis. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

To identify new members of the trithorax group, we screened a collection of deficiencies for intergenic noncomplementation with a mutation in ash1, a trithorax group gene. Five of the noncomplementing deletions uncover genes previously classified as members of the Polycomb group. This evidence suggests that there are actually three groups of genes that maintain the expression pattern of homeotic genes during Drosophila development. The products of the third group appear to be required to maintain chromatin in both transcriptionally inactive and active states. Six of the noncomplementing deficiencies uncover previously unidentified trithorax group genes. One of these deficiencies removes 25D2-3 to 26B2-5. Within this region, there are two, allelic, lethal P-insertion mutations that identify one of these new trithorax group genes.

Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis is unusual in that it is both exceptionally tolerant of nonexchange chromosomes and competent in ensuring their proper segregation. As first noted by Puro and Nokkala [Puro, J., Nokkala, S., 1977. Meiotic segregation of chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. A cytological approach. Chromosoma 63, 273-286], nonexchange chromosomes move precociously towards the poles following formation of a bipolar spindle. Indeed, metaphase arrest has been previously defined as the stage at which nonexchange homologs are symmetrically positioned between the main chromosome mass and the poles of the spindle. Here we use studies of both fixed images and living oocytes to show that the stage in which achiasmate chromosomes are separated from the main mass does not in fact define metaphase arrest, but rather is a component of an extended prometaphase. At the end of prometaphase, the nonexchange chromosomes retract into the main chromosome mass, which is tightly repackaged with properly co-oriented centromeres. This repackaged state is the true metaphase arrest configuration in Drosophila female meiosis. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In Drosophila, the single male X chromosome is hypertranscribed by approximately two-fold to effect this correction. The key genes are male lethal and appear not to be required in females, or affect their viability. Here, we show these male lethals do in fact have a role in females, and they participate in the very process which will eventually shut down their function-female determination. We find the male dosage compensation complex is required for upregulating transcription of the sex determination master switch, Sex-lethal, an X-linked gene which is specifically activated in females in response to their two X chromosomes. The levels of some X-linked genes are also affected, and some of these genes are used in the process of counting the number of X chromosomes early in development. Our data suggest that before the female state is set, the ground state is male and female X chromosome expression is elevated. Females thus utilize the male dosage compensation process to amplify the signal which determines their fate. \textcopyright{} 2010 Gladstein et al.}

Flies were transformed with an FLP gene under the control of hsp70 regulatory sequences and with a white gene flanked by FRTs. The heat-induced recombinase catalyzes recombination between FRTs, causing loss of white (seen somatically as white patches in the eye) and, less frequently, gain of white (seen as dark-red patches). Loss and gain frequencies vary with the severity of the heat shock, and patterns of mosaicism vary with the developmental stage at which the heat shock is applied. The recombinase is also active in the germline, producing white-eyed and dark-red-eyed progeny. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

  abstract = {Stem cells divide asymmetrically, regenerating a parental stem cell and giving rise to a daughter cell with a distinct fate. In many stem cell lineages, this daughter cell undergoes several amplificatory mitoses, thus generating more cells that embark on the differentiation program specific for the given lineage. Spermatogenesis in Drosophila is a model system to identify molecules regulating stem cell lineages. Mutations at two previously identified loci, bag-of-marbles (bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn), prevent progression through spermatogenesis and oogenesis, resulting in the overproliferation of undifferentiated germ cells. Here we investigate how bam and bgcn regulate the male germline stem cell lineage. By generating FLP-mediated clones, we demonstrate that both bam and bgcn act autonomously in the germline to restrict proliferation during spermatogenesis. By using enhancer trap lines, we find that the overproliferating germ cells express markers specific to amplifying germ cells, while at the same time retaining the expression of some markers of stem cell and primary spermatogonial cell fate. However, we find that germ cells accumulating in bam or bgcn mutant testes most resemble amplifying germ cells, because they undergo incomplete cytokinesis and progress through the cell cycle in synchrony within a cyst, which are two characteristics of amplifying germ cells, but not of stem cells. Taken together, our results suggest that bam and bgcn regulate progression through the male germline stem cell lineage by cell-intrinsically restricting the proliferation of amplifying germ cells.},

BAF interacts with LEM (LAP2, emerin, MAN1) domain-carrying proteins of the inner nuclear membrane. We analyzed the in vivo function of BAF in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos using both RNA interference and a temperature-sensitive baf-1 gene mutation and found that BAF is directly involved in nuclear envelope (NE) formation. NE defects were observed independent of and before the chromatin organization phenotype previously reported in BAF-depleted worms and flies. We identified vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) as a regulator of BAF phosphorylation and localization. VRK localizes both to the NE and chromatin in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Depletion of VRK results in several mitotic defects, including impaired NE formation and BAF delocalization. We propose that phosphorylation of BAF by VRK plays an essential regulatory role in the association of BAF with chromatin and nuclear membrane proteins during NE formation. \textcopyright{} 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

Induction of GAL1 increases H3 acetylation per nucleosome in the ORF, dependent on SAGA integrity but not the alternative Gcn5p-HAT complex ADA. Unexpectedly, H3 acetylation in ARG1 coding sequences does not increase during induction due to the opposing activities of multiple HDAs associated with the ORF. Remarkably, inactivation of Gcn5p decreases nucleosome eviction from both GAL1 and a long ({$\sim$}8 kb) ORF transcribed from the GAL1 promoter. This is associated with reduced Pol II occupancy at the 3{${'}$} end and decreased mRNA production, selectively, for the long ORF. Gcn5p also enhances H3-K4 trimethylation in the ARG1 ORF and bulk histones. Thus, Gcn5p, most likely in SAGA, stimulates modification and eviction of nucleosomes in transcribed coding sequences and promotes Pol II elongation. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Our investigation uncovered differential binding of these NPC subunits, where Nup107 preferentially targets active genes while Nup93 associates primarily with Polycombsilenced regions. Comparison to Lamin-associated domains (LADs) revealed that NPC binding sites can be found within LADs, demonstrating a linear binding of the genome along the nuclear envelope. Importantly, we identified a functional role of Nup93 in silencing of Polycomb target genes and in spatial folding of Polycomb domains. Our findings lend to a model where different nuclear pores bind different types of chromatin via interactions with specific NPC sub-complexes, and a subset of Polycomb domains is stabilized by interactions with Nup93.},

Although recombinant yeast Gcn5 efficiently acetylates free histones, it fails to acetylate histones contained in nucleosomes, indicating that additional components are required for acetylation of chromosomal histones. We report here that Gcn5 functions as a catalytic subunit in two high-molecular-mass native HAT complexes, with apparent molecular masses of 0.8 and 1.8 megadalton (MD), respectively, which acetylate nucleosomal histones. Both the 0.8- and 1.8-MD Gcn5-containing complexes cofractionate with Ada2 and are lost in gcn5{$\Delta$}, ada2{$\Delta$}, or ada3{$\Delta$} yeast strains, illustrating that these HAT complexes are bona fide native Ada-transcriptional adaptor complexes. Importantly, the 1.8-MD adaptor/HAT complex also contains Spt gene products that are linked to TATA-binding protein (TBP) function. This complex is lost in spt20/ada5{$\Delta$} and spt7{$\Delta$} strains and Spt3, Spt7, Spt20/Ada5, Ada2, and Gcn5 all copurify with this nucleosomal HAT complex. Therefore, the 1.8-MD adaptor/HAT complex illustrates an interaction between Ada and Spt gene products and confirms the existence of a complex containing the TBP group of Spt proteins as demonstrated by genetic and biochemical studies. We have named this novel transcription regulatory complex SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase). The function of Gcn5 as a histone acetyltransferase within the Ada and SAGA adaptor complexes indicates the importance of histone acetylation during steps in transcription activation mediated by interactions with transcription activators and general transcription factors (i.e., TBP).},

In this approach, transgenic flies expressing Cas9 are injected with plasmids to express guide RNAs (gRNAs) and positively marked donor templates. We detail target-site selection; gRNA plasmid generation; donor template design and construction; and the generation, identification, and molecular confirmation of engineered lines. We also present alternative approaches and highlight key considerations for experimental design. The approach outlined here can be used to rapidly and reliably generate a variety of engineered modifications, including genomic deletions and replacements, precise sequence edits, and incorporation of protein tags.},

This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). Here we report the effects of a host protein, large ribosomal protein 4 (RPL4), on the efficiency of recoding. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, we found that transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding RPL4 cDNA increases recoding efficiency in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal enhancement of nearly twofold. Expression of RPL4 increases recoding of reporters containing retroviral readthrough and frameshift sequences, as well as the Sindbis virus leaky termination signal. RPL4-induced enhancement of recoding is cell line specific and appears to be specific to RPL4 among ribosomal proteins. Cotransfection of RPL4 cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia proviral DNA results in Gag processing defects and a reduction of viral particle formation, presumably caused by the RPL4-dependent alteration of the Gag-to-Gag-Pol ratio required for virion assembly and release.}

The oocytes of most animal species arrest during meiotic prophase, and complete meiosis in response to intercellular signaling in a process called meiotic maturation. Oocyte meiotic maturation is defined by the transition between diakinesis and metaphase of meiosis I and is accompanied by nuclear envelope breakdown, rearrangement of the cortical cytoskeleton, and meiotic spindle assembly. Thus, the meiotic maturation process is essential for meiosis and prepares the oocyte for fertilization. In C. elegans, the processes of meiotic maturation, ovulation, and fertilization are temporally coupled: sperm utilize the major sperm protein as a hormone to trigger oocyte meiotic maturation, and in turn, the maturing oocyte signals its own ovulation thereby facilitating fertilization. This chapter highlights recent advances in understanding meiotic maturation signaling and gametic interactions required for fertilization.},

We have investigated how the microtubule network polarizes using a GFP-tubulin construct that allows germ-cell microtubules to be visualized with greater sensitivity than in previous studies. Unexpectedly, microtubules are seen to associate with the fusome, an asymmetric germline-specific organelle, which elaborates as cysts form and undergoes complex changes during cyst polarization. This fusome-microtubule association occurs periodically during late interphases of cyst divisions and then continuously in 16-cell cysts that have entered meiotic prophase. As meiotic cysts move through the germarium, microtubule minus ends progressively focus towards the center of the fusome, as visualized using a NOD-lacZ marker. During this same period, discrete foci rich in {$\gamma$} tubulin that very probably correspond to migrating cystocyte centrosomes also associate with the fusome, first on the fusome arms and then in its center, subsequently moving into the differentiating oocyte. The fusome is required for this complex process, because microtubule network organization and polarization are disrupted in hts1 mutant cysts, which lack fusomes. Our results suggest that the fusome, a specialized membrane-skeletal structure, which arises in early germ cells, plays a crucial role in polarizing 16-cell cysts, at least in part by interacting with microtubules and centrosomes.},

  abstract = {TAF4b is a gonadal-enriched subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID that is implicated in promoting healthy ovarian aging and female fertility in mice and humans. To further explore the potential mechanism of TAF4b in promoting ovarian follicle development, we analyzed global gene expression at multiple time points in the human fetal ovary. This computational analysis revealed coordinate expression of human TAF4B and critical regulators and effectors of meiosis I including SYCP3, YBX2, STAG3, and DAZL. To address the functional relevance of this analysis, we turned to the embryonic Taf4b-deficient mouse ovary where, for the first time, we demonstrate, severe deficits in prophase I progression as well as asynapsis in Taf4b-deficient oocytes. Accordingly, TAF4b occupies the proximal promoters of many essential meiosis and oogenesis regulators, including Stra8, Dazl, Figla, and Nobox, and is required for their proper expression. These data reveal a novel TAF4b function in regulating a meiotic gene expression program in early mouse oogenesis, and support the existence of a highly conserved TAF4b-dependent gene regulatory network promoting early oocyte development in both mice and women.}

We have developed a fluorescently labeled recombinant M. jannaschii RNAP system to probe the archaeal transcription initiation complex, consisting of promoter DNA, TBP, TFB, TFE, and RNAP. We have localized the position of the TFE winged helix (WH) and Zinc ribbon (ZR) domains on the RNAP using single-molecule FRET. The interaction sites of the TFE WH domain and the transcription elongation factor Spt4/5 overlap, and both factors compete for RNAP binding. Binding of Spt4/5 to RNAP represses promoter-directed transcription in the absence of TFE, which alleviates this effect by displacing Spt4/5 from RNAP. During elongation, Spt4/5 can displace TFE from the RNAP elongation complex and stimulate processivity. Our results identify the RNAP " clamp" region as a regulatory hot spot for both transcription initiation and transcription elongation. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.}

We show that the three TFIIE winged-helix (WH) domains form a heterodimer, with the Tfa1 (TFIIE{$\alpha$}) WH binding the Pol II clamp and the Tfa2 (TFIIE{$\beta$}) tandem WH domain encircling promoter DNA that becomes single-stranded in the open complex. Ssl2 lies adjacent to TFIIE, enclosing downstream promoter DNA. Unlike previous proposals, comparison of the PIC and open-complex models strongly suggests that Ssl2 promotes DNA opening by functioning as a double-stranded-DNA translocase, feeding 15 base pairs into the Pol II cleft. Right-handed threading of DNA through the Ssl2 binding groove, combined with the fixed position of upstream promoter DNA, leads to DNA unwinding and the open state. \textcopyright{} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

The evidence provided is supplemented with data on isolated karyospheres in Rana temporaria oocytes. A conclusion is made that the karyosphere is a complex structure which contains all chromosomes in the limited space of the oocyte nucleus, and that these chromosomes are, as a rule, in the process of inactivation. It is inferred that the karyosphere capsule commonly appears in gigantic oocyte nuclei (more than 100 micron in diameter) containing extrachromosomal DNA. The analogy of capsule organization in different invertebrate and vertebrate species is discussed, in addition to the involvement of presumably homologous nuclear structures (e.g. derivatives of synaptonemal complexes and nuclear envelope) in capsule formation. It is assumed that the karyosphere capsule is a specially organized part of the nuclear matrix. The capsule provides nuclear compartmentalization and chromosome localization in the germinal vesicle. Studies of this sort open up new possibilities to further investigation of intranuclear morphogenesis.},

Karyosphere is formed as the result of all chromosomes of the gametocyte joining in a limited nuclear volume with final formation of a single complex chromatin structure\textemdash a type of nucleus inside the germinal vesicle. Karyosphere formation is the result of relative inactivity of chromosomes during RNA synthesis because it is formed either in nutrimental oogenesis or after a long period of lampbrush-chromosome activity. Formation of the karyosphere is accompanied by intensive nuclear cytoplasmic exchange that results in the appearance of numerous protein granules and bodies in the karyosphere and their subsequent transfer toward the nuclear periphery. Karyosphere is quite common in gametogenesis\textemdash in particular, oogenesis. The stage of gametogenesis in which the karyosphere is formed is always a longterm diplotene of meiosis. In vertebrates, karyosphere formation is paralleled by the appearance around the chromosomes of newly formed capsule-shaped structures. A characteristic trait of karyosphere in some species is that it is surrounded by a multilayered capsule. The capsule usually appears in large germinal vesicles rather than in small nuclei. \textcopyright{} 1993 Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V.}

As mitosis inhibits not only transcription, but also pre-mRNA splicing, we reasoned that constraints on splicing were likely to exist in the early embryo, being splicing avoidance a possible explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless. We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. We hypothesized that the requirements for pre-mRNA splicing efficiency were likely to vary during development. Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic pre-mRNA was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects in the mutant background. Furthermore, a small early zygotic transcript with multiple introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the existence of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during Drosophila early embryonic development and suggest in highly proliferative tissues a need for coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture to ensure correct gene expression and avoid abnormally processed transcripts. \textcopyright{} Guilgur et al.},

The ribosome \textemdash{} the cellular machine that mediates protein synthesis \textemdash{} is typically seen as a key, but invariant, player in this process. This is because translational control is thought to be mediated by other auxiliary factors while ribosome recruitment is seen as the end-point of regulation. However, recent developments have made it clear that heterogeneous ribosome types can exist in different tissues, and more importantly, that these ribosomes can preferentially translate different subsets of mRNAs. In so doing, heterogeneous ribosomes could be key regulatory players in differentiation and development. Here, we examine current evidence for the existence of different ribosome types and how they might arise. In particular, we will take a close look at the mechanisms through which these ribosomes might mediate selective mRNA translation. We also summarize recently developed techniques/approaches that will aid in our understanding of the functions of such specialized ribosomes.}

In this Review, we discuss the defining properties of gene core promoters, including their sequence features, chromatin architecture and transcription initiation patterns. We provide an overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of core promoters and their emerging functional diversity, which defines distinct transcription programmes. On the basis of the established properties of gene core promoters, we discuss transcription start sites within enhancers and integrate recent results obtained from dedicated functional assays to propose a functional model of transcription initiation. This model can explain the nature and function of transcription initiation at gene starts and at enhancers and can explain the different roles of core promoters, of Pol II and its associated factors and of the activating cues provided by enhancers and the transcription factors and cofactors they recruit.},

Analysis of H3K36me3 profiles indicated that this intragenic mark of active genes is associated with two categories of genes: (i) genes with low CpG density and H3K9me3 in the gene body or (ii) genes with high CpG density and DNA methylation in the gene body. We observed that a combination of low CpG density in gene bodies together with H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 occupancy is a specific epigenetic feature of zinc finger (ZNF) genes, which comprise 90\% of all genes carrying both histone marks on chromosome 19. For genes with high intragenic CpG density, transcription and H3K36me3 occupancy were not changed in conditions of partial or intensive loss of DNA methylation in gene bodies. siRNA knockdown of SETD2, the major histone methyltransferase responsible for production of H3K36me3, did not reduce DNA methylation in gene bodies. Our study suggests that the H3K36me3 and DNA methylation marks in gene bodies are established largely independently of each other and points to similar functional roles of intragenic DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 for CpG-rich and CpG-poor genes, respectively. \textcopyright{} 2011 Hahn et al.}

Analysis of structure-based mutants revealed that MSL2 can only interact with the MSL1 dimer, but MSL1 dimerization is MSL2 independent. We show that Msl1 is a substrate for Msl2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. ChIP experiments revealed that Msl1 dimerization is essential for targeting and spreading of the MSL complex on X-linked genes; however, Msl1 binding to promoters of male and female cells is independent of the dimer status and other MSL proteins. Finally, we show that loss of Msl1 dimerization leads to male-specific lethality. We propose that Msl1-mediated dimerization of the entire MSL complex is required for Msl2 binding, X chromosome recognition, and spreading along the X chromosome. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

  abstract = {Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) requires interaction between cis-acting promoter elements and trans-acting factors. The eukaryotic promoter consists of core elements, which include the TATA box and other DNA sequences that define transcription start sites, and regulatory elements, which either enhance or repress transcription in a gene-specific manner. The core promoter is the site for assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which includes RNA pol II and the general transcription fctors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Regulatory elements bind gene-specific factors, which affect the rate of transcription by interacting, either directly or indirectly, with components of the general transcriptional machinery. A third class of transcription factors, termed coactivators, is not required for basal transcription in vitro but often mediates activation by a broad spectrum of activators. Accordingly, coactivators are neither gene-specific nor general transcription factors, although gene-specific coactivators have been described in metazoan systems. Transcriptional repressors include both gene-specific and general factors. Similar to coactivators, general transcriptional repressors affect the expression of a broad spectrum of genes yet do not repress all genes. General repressors either act through the core transcriptional machinery or are histone related and presumably affect chromatin function. This review focuses on the global effectors of RNA polymerase II transcription in yeast, including the general transcription factors, the coactivators, and the general repressors. Emphasis is placed on the role that yeast genetics has played in identifying these factors and their associated functions.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is an essential stage in gamete formation in all sexually reproducing organisms. Studies of mutations in model organisms and of human haplotype patterns are leading to a clearer understanding of how meiosis has adapted from yeast to humans, the genes that control the dynamics of chromosomes during meiosis, and how meiosis is tied to gametic success. Genetic disruptions and meiotic errors have important roles in infertility and the aetiology of developmental defects, especially aneuploidy. An understanding of the regulation of meiosis, coupled with advances in genomics, may ultimately allow us to diagnose the causes of meiosis-based infertilities, more wisely apply assisted reproductive technologies, and derive functional germ cells. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our data demonstrate that nos-3 promotes GLD-1 accumulation redundantly with gld-2, and that nos-3 functions genetically downstream or parallel to fbf, an inhibitor of GLD-1 translation. We show that the GLD-1 accumulation pattern is important in controlling the proliferation versus meiotic development decision, with low GLD-1 levels allowing proliferation and increased levels promoting meiotic entry.},

In this work, we report new genetic and biochemical studies of Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 that reveal a role for these factors in transcription elongation. We have isolated conditional mutations in SPT5 that can be suppressed in an allele-specific manner by mutations in the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Strikingly, one of these RNA Pol II mutants is defective for transcription elongation and the others cause phenotypes consistent with an elongation defect. In addition, we show that spt4, spt5, and spt6 mutants themselves have phenotypes suggesting defects in transcription elongation in vivo. Consistent with these findings, we show that Spt5 is physically associated with RNA Po1 II in vivo, and have identified a region of sequence similarity between Spt5 and NusG, an Escherichia coli transcription elongation factor that binds directly to RNA polymerase. Finally, we show that Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex that does not contain Spt6. These results, taken together with the biochemical identification of a human Spt4-Spt5 complex as a transcription elongation factor (Wada et al. 1998), provide strong evidence that these factors are important for transcription elongation in vivo.},

Among the nuclear pore complex proteins, Nup107 co-localized with Lam during this meiotic division. Surprisingly, Lam depletion resulted in a higher frequency of cytokinesis failure in male meiosis. We also observed the similar meiotic phenotype in Nup107-depleted cells. Abnormal localization of Lam was found in the Nup-depleted cells at premeiotic and meiotic stages. The central spindle microtubules became abnormal and recruitment of a contractile ring component to the cleavage sites was disrupted in Lam-depleted cells and Nup107-depleted cells. Therefore, we speculate that both proteins are required for a reinforcement of the spindle envelope, which supports the formation of central spindle microtubules essential for cytokinesis in Drosophila male meiosis.},

In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, the dosage-compensation complex promotes twofold hypertranscription of the single male X-chromosome and is silenced in females by inhibition of the translation of msl2, which codes for the limiting component of the dosage-compensation complex. The female-specific protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) recruits Upstream-of-N-ras (Unr) to the 3' untranslated region of msl2 messenger RNA, preventing the engagement of the small ribosomal subunit. Here we report the 2.8 \textbackslash AA crystal structure, NMR and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data of the ternary Sxl-Unr-msl2 ribonucleoprotein complex featuring unprecedented intertwined interactions of two Sxl RNA recognition motifs, a Unr cold-shock domain and RNA. Cooperative complex formation is associated with a 1,000-fold increase of RNA binding affinity for the Unr cold-shock domain and involves novel ternary interactions, as well as non-canonical RNA contacts by the {$\alpha$} 1 helix of Sxl RNA recognition motif 1. Our results suggest that repression of dosage compensation, necessary for female viability, is triggered by specific, cooperative molecular interactions that lock a ribonucleoprotein switch to regulate translation. The structure serves as a paradigm for how a combination of general and widespread RNA binding domains expands the code for specific single-stranded RNA recognition in the regulation of gene expression.}

We provide evidence that, in contrast, histone H2B monoubiquitylation and its deubiquitylation are both involved in gene activation. Substitution of the H2B ubiquitylation site at Lys 123 (K123) lowered transcription of certain genes regulated by the acetylation complex SAGA. Gene-associated H2B ubiquitylation was transient, increasing early during activation, and then decreasing coincident with significant RNA accumulation. We show that Ubp8, a component of the SAGA acetylation complex, is required for SAGA-mediated deubiquitylation of histone H2B in vitro. Loss of Ubp8 in vivo increased both gene-associated and overall cellular levels of ubiquitylated H2B. Deletion of Ubp8 lowered transcription of SAGA-regulated genes, and the severity of this defect was exacerbated by codeletion of the Gcn5 acetyltransferase within SAGA. In addition, disruption of either ubiquitylation or Ubp8-mediated deubiquitylation of H2B resulted in altered levels of gene-associated H3 Lys 4 methylation and Lys 36 methylation, which have both been linked to transcription. These results suggest that the histone H2B ubiquitylation state is dynamic during transcription, and that the sequence of histone modifications helps to control transcription.},

  abstract = {Mitochondria contain their own genome which codes for a small number of proteins. Most mitochondrial translation products are part of the membrane-embedded reaction centers of the respiratory chain complexes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of these proteins is regulated by translational activators that bind mitochondrial mRNAs, in most cases to their 5'-untranslated regions, and each mitochondrial mRNA appears to have its own translational activator(s). Recent studies showed that these translational activators can be part of feedback control loops which only permit translation if the downstream assembly of nascent translation products can occur. In several cases, the accumulation of a non-assembled protein prevents further synthesis of this protein but not translation in general. These control loops prevent the synthesis of potentially harmful assembly intermediates of the reaction centers of mitochondrial enzymes. Since such regulatory feedback loops only work if translation occurs in the compartment in which the complexes of the respiratory chain are assembled, these control mechanisms require the presence of a translation machinery in mitochondria. This might explain why eukaryotic cells maintained DNA in mitochondria during the last two billion years of evolution. This review gives an overview of the mitochondrial translation system and summarizes the current knowledge on translational activators and their role in the regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis.

In order to control tissue and promoter specific gene expression, transcription factors must work in concert with each other and with the promoter DNA to form the proper architecture to activate the gene of interest. The TATA binding protein (TBP) binds to TATA boxes in core promoters and bends the TATA DNA. We have used quantitative solution fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and gel-based FRET (gelFRET) to determine the effect of TFIIA on the conformation of the DNA in TBP/TATA complexes and on the kinetic stability of these complexes. Our results indicate that human TFIIA decreases the angle to which human TBP bends consensus TATA DNA from 104\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree{} when calculated using a two-kink model. The kinetic stability of TBP/TATA complexes was greatly reduced by increasing the KCl concentration from 50 mM to 140 mM, which is more physiologically relevant. TFIIA significantly enhanced the kinetic stability of TBP/TATA complexes, thereby attenuating the effect of higher salt concentrations. We also found that TBP bent non-consensus TATA DNA to a lesser degree than consensus TATA DNA and complexes between TBP and a non-consensus TATA box were kinetically unstable even at 50 mM KCl. Interestingly, TFIIA increased the calculated bend angle and kinetic stability of complexes on a non-consensus TATA box, making them similar to those on a consensus TATA box. Our data show that TFIIA induces a conformational change within the TBP/TATA complex that enhances its stability under both in vitro and physiological salt conditions. Furthermore, we present a refined model for the effect that TFIIA has on DNA conformation that takes into account potential changes in bend angle as well as twist angle. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Emerin has proposed roles in nuclear architecture and gene regulation, but direct molecular links to disease were unknown. We report that Lim-domain only 7 (Lmo7) binds emerin directly with 125 nM affinity; the C-terminal half of human Lmo7 (hLmo7C) was sufficient to bind emerin in vitro. Lmo7 appeared relevant to EDMD because a deletion that removes Lmo7 (plus eight exons of a neighboring gene) in mice causes dystrophic muscles [Semenova, E., Wang, X., Jablonski, M.M., Levorse, J. and Tilghman, S.M.

Genet., 12, 1301-1312]. Lmo7 localizes in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell surface, particularly adhesion junctions [Ooshio, T., Irie, K., Morimoto, K., Fukuhara, A., Imai, T. and Takai, Y.

Our data suggest endogenous Lmo7 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and might also localize at focal adhesions in HeLa cells. Two key results show that Lmo7 regulates emerin gene expression: rat Lmo7 isoforms directly activated a luciferase reporter gene in vivo, and emerin mRNA expression decreased 93\% in Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells. Thus, Lmo7 not only binds emerin protein but is also required for emerin gene transcription. Microarray analysis of Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells identified over 4200 misregulated genes, including 46 genes important for muscle or heart. Misregulation of 11 genes, including four (CREBBP, NAP1L1, LAP2, RBL2) known to be misregulated in X-EDMD patients and emerin-null mice [Bakay, M., Wang, Z., Melcon, G., Schiltz, L., Xuan, J., Zhao, P., Sartorelli, V., Seo, J., Pegoraro, E., Angelini, C. et al.

Overexpression of wild-type emerin, but not emerin mutant P183H (which causes EDMD and selectively disrupts binding to Lmo7), decreased the expression of CREBBP, NAP1L1 and LAP2, suggesting Lmo7 activity is both EDMD-relevant and inhibited by direct binding to emerin. We conclude that Lmo7 positively regulates many EDMD-relevant genes (including emerin), and is feedback-regulated by binding to emerin. \textcopyright{} 2006 Oxford University Press.}

This study investigates the biological significance of perinuclear positioning for heterochromatin maintenance and gene silencing. We identify the nuclear rim protein Amo1NUPL2 as a factor required for the propagation of heterochromatin at endogenous and ectopic sites in the fission yeast genome. Amo1 associates with the Rix1PELP1-containing RNA processing complex RIXC and with the histone chaperone complex FACT. RIXC, which binds to heterochromatin protein Swi6HP1 across silenced chromosomal domains and to surrounding boundary elements, connects heterochromatin with Amo1 at the nuclear periphery. In turn, the Amo1-enriched subdomain is critical for Swi6 association with FACT that precludes histone turnover to promote gene silencing and preserve epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. In addition to uncovering conserved factors required for perinuclear positioning of heterochromatin, these analyses elucidate a mechanism by which a peripheral subdomain enforces stable gene repression and maintains heterochromatin in a heritable manner.,                     , A conserved machinery that localizes heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery promotes spreading and epigenetic inheritance of the repressive chromatin state.},

Although the functional significance of N(6)-methyladenosine is unknown, the Inducer of MEiosis 4 (IME4) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, is required for gametogenesis. Here we find that the Drosophila IME4 homolog, Dm ime4, is expressed in ovaries and testes, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function for this enzyme in gametogenesis. In contrast to yeast, but as in Arabidopsis, Dm ime4 is essential for viability. Lethality is rescued fully by a wild-type transgenic copy of Dm ime4 but not by introducing mutations shown to abrogate the catalytic activity of yeast Ime4, indicating functional conservation of the catalytic domain. The phenotypes of hypomorphic alleles of Dm ime4 that allow recovery of viable adults reveal critical functions for this gene in oogenesis. Ovarioles from Dm ime4 mutants have fused egg chambers with follicle-cell defects similar to those observed when Notch signaling is defective. Indeed, using a reporter for Notch activation, we find markedly reduced levels of Notch signaling in follicle cells of Dm ime4 mutants. This phenotype of Dm ime4 mutants is rescued by inducing expression of a constitutively activated form of Notch. Our study reveals the function of IME4 in a metazoan. In yeast, this enzyme is responsible for a crucial developmental decision, whereas in Drosophila it appears to target the conserved Notch signaling pathway, which regulates many vital aspects of metazoan development.},

  abstract = {Background: Histone post-translational modifications are critical determinants of chromatin structure and function, impacting multiple biological processes including DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The post-translational acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) was initially identified in association with dosage compensation of the Drosophila male X chromosome. However, in mammalian cells, H4K16ac is not associated with dosage compensation and the genomic distribution of H4K16ac is not precisely known. Therefore, we have mapped the genome-wide H4K16ac distribution in human cells.Results: We performed H4K16ac chromatin immunoprecipitation from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells followed by hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays and identified 25,893 DNA regions (false discovery rate \textbackslash textless0.005) with average length of 692 nucleotides. Interestingly, although a majority of H4K16ac sites localized within genes, only a relatively small fraction ({$\sim$}10\%) was found near promoters, in contrast to the distribution of the acetyltransferase, MOF, responsible for acetylation at K16 of H4. Using differential gene expression profiling data, 73 genes (\textbackslash textgreater {$\pm$}1.5-fold) were identified as potential H4K16ac-regulated genes. Seventeen transcription factor-binding sites were significantly associated with H4K16ac occupancy (p \textbackslash textless 0.0005). In addition, a consensus 12-nucleotide guanine-rich sequence motif was identified in more than 55\% of the H4K16ac peaks.Conclusions: The results suggest that H4K16 acetylation has a limited effect on transcription regulation in HEK293 cells, whereas H4K16ac has been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, H4K16ac-dependent transcription regulation is likely a cell type specific process. \textcopyright{} 2013 Horikoshi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Accumulating evidence from primary tumors and model systems supports a role for KDM5A (JARID1A/RBP2) and KDM5B (JARID1B/PLU1) as oncogenic drivers. The KDM5 family is unique among the Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases in that there is an atypical insertion of a DNA-binding ARID domain and a histone-binding PHD domain into the Jumonji domain, which separates the catalytic domain into two fragments (JmjN and JmjC). Here we demonstrate that internal deletion of the ARID and PHD1 domains has a negligible effect on in vitro enzymatic kinetics of the KDM5 family of enzymes. We present a crystal structure of the linked JmjN-JmjC domain from KDM5A, which reveals that the linked domain fully reconstitutes the cofactor (metal ion and {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate) binding characteristics of other structurally characterized Jumonji domain demethylases. Docking studies with GSK-J1, a selective inhibitor of the KDM6/KDM5 subfamilies, identify critical residues for binding of the inhibitor to the reconstituted KDM5 Jumonji domain. Further, we found that GSK-J1 inhibited the demethylase activity of KDM5C with 8.5-fold increased potency compared with that of KDM5B at 1 mM {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate. In contrast, JIB-04 (a paninhibitor of the Jumonji demethylase superfamily) had the opposite effect and was {$\sim$}8-fold more potent against KDM5B than against KDM5C. Interestingly, the relative selectivity of JIB-04 toward KDM5B over KDM5C in vitro translates to a - 10-50-fold greater growth-inhibitory activity against breast cancer cell lines. These data define the minimal requirements for enzymatic activity of the KDM5 familytobethe linked JmjN-JmjC domain coupled with the immediate C-terminal helical zinc-binding domain and provide structural characterization of the linked JmjN-JmjC domain for the KDM5 family, which should prove useful in the design of KDM5 demethylase inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity.}

  abstract = {We have analysed the endogenous retinoids present in whole mouse embryos from day 9 to day 14 of development and in individual components of the embryo at two stages, day 10.5 and day 13, by HPLC. We can only detect two retinoids, all-trans -RA (tRA) and all-trans -retinol (t-retinol), and t-retinol is 5-10-fold in excess over tRA. We cannot detect 9-cis -RA or any didehydroretinoids; thus mammalian embryos seem to differ in their retinoid content from other embryos such as chick, Xenopus, and fish. The levels of tRA do not change significantly over the 6 days of development analysed, whereas t-retinol rises sharply as the liver develops. Within the embryo, tRA is present at high levels in the developing spinal cord and at very low levels in the forebrain; indeed there is a gradient of endogenous tRA from the forebrain to the spinal cord. Other parts of the embryo had intermediate levels of tRA. When a teratogenic dose of RA was administered to day 10.5 embryos, the levels of tRA present in individual tissues of the embryo rose dramatically\textemdash from 175-fold to 1,400-fold\textemdash and the levels rose in all tissues not in any exclusive areas. We then determined which areas of the embryo were malformed by such a teratogenic dose. The lower jaw, palate, vertebrae, tail, and limbs were consistently abnormal, and since these areas received a dose of tRA no higher than any other it was concluded that cell-specific factors must determine the teratogenic response of these tissues. We then considered whether cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I or II (CRABP I or II) played any role in this response by determining their relative levels in each of the tissues analysed. There was no correlation between the presence of CRABP I and II and the distribution of administered RA. Neither was there a clear correlation in detail between the presence of CRABP I and II and the sites of teratogenesis. We therefore conclude that other factors, for example, nuclear factors, must be responsible for the teratogenic response to RA. \textcopyright{} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The biological function of YTHDC2, the final member of the YTH protein family, remains unknown. We report that YTHDC2 selectively binds m6A at its consensus motif. YTHDC2 enhances the translation efficiency of its targets and also decreases their mRNA abundance. Ythdc2 knockout mice are infertile; males have significantly smaller testes and females have significantly smaller ovaries compared to those of littermates. The germ cells of Ythdc2 knockout mice do not develop past the zygotene stage and accordingly, Ythdc2 is upregulated in the testes as meiosis begins.

Within a 10-kb genomic fragment that contains ori62 and is sufficient for amplification, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that all detected RNAs mapped solely to the yellow-g2 gene. To determine whether transcription is required in cis for ori62 firing, we generated a set of tagged yellow-g2 transgenes in which we could prevent local transcription across ori62 by deletions in the yellow-g2 promoter. Surprisingly, inhibition of yellow-g2 transcription by promoter deletions did not affect ori62 firing. Our results reveal that transcription in cis is not required for ori62 firing, raising the possibility that a trans-acting factor is required specifically for the activation of ori62. This finding illustrates that a diversity of mechanisms can be used in the regulation of metazoan DNA replication initiation.},

These intronic marks were spatially reciprocal to trimethylated histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36me3), typically transitioning near internal exons. Several marks transitioned near bona fide exons, but not near nucleosomes at exon-like sequences. Therefore, we examined whether splicing affects histone marking. Even with considerable changes in regulated alternative splicing, histone marks were stable. Notably, these findings are consistent with exon definition influencing histone marks.

To ensure optimal execution of this process, crossing over must occur between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers form only in the presence of a large proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC), which forms between homologs during early meiosis. How SC components assemble in a controlled manner into a normal ribbon-like structure between homologs is poorly understood. In female fruit flies, mutations in seven in absentia (sina) cause SC components to self-assemble into large structures called polycomplexes, rather than into normal SC. Sina is a member of a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are present in a number of organisms and target other proteins for degradation. We propose that there are proteins that promote the assembly of SC components into polycomplexes, and that Sina is required to degrade such proteins, allowing the normal assembly of SC components between homologous chromosomes.}

Using an antibody that recognises a component of the SC or the synapsed chromosomes, we have analysed how meiosis becomes restricted to one cell, in relation to the other events in oocyte determination. Although BicD and egl mutants both cause the development of cysts with no oocyte, they have opposite effects on the behaviour of the SC: none of the cells in the cyst form SC in BicD null mutants, whereas all of the cells do in egl and orb mutants. Furthermore, unlike all cytoplasmic markers for the oocyte, the SC still becomes restricted to one cell when the microtubules are depolymerised, even though the BicD/Egl complex is not localised. These results lead us to propose a model in which BicD, Egl and Orb control entry into meiosis by regulating translation.},

  abstract = {Imitation switch (ISWI)-family remodelling enzymes regulate access to genomic DNA by mobilizing nucleosomes. These ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers promote heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing by generating regularly spaced nucleosome arrays. The nucleosome-spacing activity arises from the dependence of nucleosome translocation on the length of extranucleosomal linker DNA, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we study nucleosome remodelling by human ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodelling factor (ACF), an ISWI enzyme comprising a catalytic subunit, Snf2h, and an accessory subunit, Acf1 (refs 2, 11, 12, 13). We find that ACF senses linker DNA length through an interplay between its accessory and catalytic subunits mediated by the histone H4 tail of the nucleosome. Mutation of AutoN, an auto-inhibitory domain within Snf2h that bears sequence homology to the H4 tail, abolishes the linker-length sensitivity in remodelling. Addition of exogenous H4-tail peptide or deletion of the nucleosomal H4 tail also diminishes the linker-length sensitivity. Moreover, Acf1 binds both the H4-tail peptide and DNA in an amino (N)-terminal domain dependent manner, and in the ACF-bound nucleosome, lengthening the linker DNA reduces the Acf1-H4 tail proximity. Deletion of the N-terminal portion of Acf1 (or its homologue in yeast) abolishes linker-length sensitivity in remodelling and leads to severe growth defects in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanism for nucleosome spacing where linker DNA sensing by Acf1 is allosterically transmitted to Snf2h through the H4 tail of the nucleosome. For nucleosomes with short linker DNA, Acf1 preferentially binds to the H4 tail, allowing AutoN to inhibit the ATPase activity of Snf2h. As the linker DNA lengthens, Acf1 shifts its binding preference to the linker DNA, freeing the H4 tail to compete AutoN off the ATPase and thereby activating ACF. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In addition, distinct effector proteins ('readers') recognize specific methyl-lysines in a manner that depends on the neighboring amino-Acid sequence and methylation state. Misregulation of histone lysine methylation has been implicated in several cancers and developmental defects. Therefore, histone lysine methylation has been considered a potential therapeutic target, and clinical trials of several inhibitors of this process have shown promising results. A more detailed understanding of histone lysine methylation is necessary for elucidating complex biological processes and, ultimately, for developing and improving disease treatments. This review summarizes enzymes responsible for histone lysine methylation and demethylation and how histone lysine methylation contributes to various biological processes. \& 2017 KSBMB.},

Among proteins involved in chromatin reorganization, TIP60 histone acetyltransferase has been shown to play a role in DNA repair and apoptosis. However, how TIP60 regulates chromatin reorganization in the response of human cells to DNA damage is largely unknown. Here, we show that ionizing irradiation induces TIP60 acetylation of histone H2AX, a variant form of H2A known to be phosphorylated following DNA damage. Furthermore, TIP60 regulates the ubiquitination of H2AX via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13, which is induced by DNA damage. This ubiquitination of H2AX requires its prior acetylation. We also demonstrate that acetylation-dependent ubiquitination by the TIP60-UBC13 complex leads to the release of H2AX from damaged chromatin. We conclude that the sequential acetylation and ubiquitination of H2AX by TIP60-UBC13 promote enhanced histone dynamics, which in turn stimulate a DNA damage response.

Here, by using UV crosslinking followed by deep sequencing, we show that two enzymes in the Male-Specific Lethal complex, MLE RNA helicase and MSL2 ubiquitin ligase, bind evolutionarily conserved domains containing tandem stem-loops in roX1 and roX2 RNAs invivo. Thesedomains constitute the minimal RNA unit present in multiple copies in diverse arrangements for nucleation of the MSL complex. MLE binds to these domains with distinct ATP-independent and ATP-dependent behavior. Importantly, we show that different roX RNA domains have overlapping function, since only combinatorial mutations in thetandem stem-loops result in severe loss of dosage compensation and consequently male-specific lethality.

Mothers against dpp (Mad) is a pathway-specific Smad, whereas Daughters against dpp (Dad) is an inhibitory Smad genetically shown to antagonize Dpp signaling. Here we report the identification of a common mediator Smad in Drosophila, which is closely related to human Smad4. Mad forms a heteromeric complex with Drosophila Smad4 (Medea) upon phosphorylation by Thick veins (Tkv), a type I receptor for Dpp. Dad stably associates with Tkv and thereby inhibits Tkv-induced Mad phosphorylation. Dad also blocks hetero- oligomerization and nuclear translocation of Mad. We also show that Mad exists as a monomer in the absence of Tkv stimulation. Tkv induces homo- oligomerization of Mad, and Dad inhibits this step. Finally, we propose a model for Dpp signaling by Drosophila Smad proteins.},

Mutation of the enzymatic PRC2 subunit Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) in the germline abolishes spatial and temporal control of the cell cycle and induces sterility via transdetermination of the oocyte into a nurse-like cell. This fate switch depends on loss of silencing of two PRC2 target genes, Cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dacapo. By contrast, the PRC1 component Polycomb ( Pc) plays no role in this process. Our results demonstrate that PRC2 plays an exquisite role in the determination of the oocyte fate by preventing its switching into an endoreplicative program. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.}

The metaphase I arrest and the karyosome, a critical prophase I chromosomal structure, require nucleosomal histone kinase-1 (NHK-1) function. The defects are a result of failure to disassemble the synaptonemal complex and to load condensin onto the mutant chromosomes. Embryos laid by nhk-1-/- mutant females arrest with aberrant polar bodies and mitotic spindles, revealing that mitosis is affected as well. We analyzed the role of Histone H2A phosphorylation with respect to the histone code hypothesis and found that it is required for acetylation of Histone H3 and Histone H4 in meiosis.

Histone modifications play pivotal roles in conferring structural diversity to chromosomes by influencing the compactness of chromatin. Several multi-protein complexes bind to chromatin and affect chromosome dynamics, including cohesin, condensin, the chromosome passenger complex, and the synaptonemal complex. The roles of these complexes in promoting chromosome functions include cohesion, condensation and synapsis. It is now crucial to define the relationship between the protein complexes that affect chromosome architecture and the underlying state of the chromatin. During meiosis chromosomes undergo striking morphological changes, including alignment of homologous chromosomes, double-strand break formation and repair, and establishment of meiosis-specific chromosome structures. These dynamic chromosome arrangements are accompanied by the recruitment and expulsion of multi-protein complexes from chromatin. Meiotic chromosome dynamics ensure proper chromosome segregation and production of healthy gametes. Meiosis thus affords an excellent opportunity to determine how histone modifications impact higher order chromosome dynamics by affecting localization and function of chromosome protein complexes. A mutation in the Drosophila histone kinase, NHK-1, uncovered a critical requirement for histone modifications in meiotic chromosome architecture, underscoring the power of this approach. \textcopyright 2006 Landes Bioscience.},

We show that the X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) gene SMCX (JARID1C), which encodes a JmjC-domain protein, reversed H3K4me3 to di- and mono- but not unmethylated products. Other SMCX family members, including SMCY, RBP2, and PLU-1, also demethylated H3K4me3. SMCX bound H3K9me3 via its N-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain) finger, which may help coordinate H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation in transcriptional repression. Significantly, several XLMR-patient point mutations reduced SMCX demethylase activity and binding to H3K9me3 peptides, respectively. Importantly, studies in zebrafish and primary mammalian neurons demonstrated a role for SMCX in neuronal survival and dendritic development and a link to the demethylase activity. Our findings thus identify a family of H3K4me3 demethylases and uncover a critical link between histone modifications and XLMR. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Translation termination in eukaryotes occurs in response to a stop codon in the ribosomal A-site and requires two release factors (RFs), eRF1 and eRF3, which bind to the A-site as an eRF1/eRF3/GTP complex with eRF1 responsible for codon recognition. After GTP hydrolysis by eRF3, eRF1 triggers hydrolysis of the polypeptidyl-tRNA, releasing the completed protein product. This leaves an 80S ribosome still bound to the mRNA, with deacylated tRNA in its P-site and at least eRF1 in its A-site, which needs to be disassembled and released from the mRNA to allow further rounds of translation. The first step in recycling is dissociation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, leaving a 40S/deacylated tRNA complex bound to the mRNA. This is mediated by ABCE1, which is a somewhat unusual member of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins with no membrane-spanning domain but two essential iron-sulfur clusters. Two distinct pathways have been identified for subsequent ejection of the deacylated tRNA followed by dissociation of the 40S subunit from the mRNA, one executed by a subset of the canonical initiation factors (which therefore starts the process of preparing the 40S subunit for the next round of translation) and the other by Ligatin or homologous proteins. However, although this is the normal sequence of events, there are exceptions where the termination reaction is followed by reinitiation on the same mRNA (usually) at a site downstream of the stop codon. The overwhelming majority of such reinitiation events occur when the 5{${'}$}-proximal open reading frame (ORF) is short and can result in significant regulation of translation of the protein-coding ORF, but there are also rare examples, mainly bicistronic viral RNAs, of reinitiation after a long ORF. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of termination, ribosome recycling, and reinitiation after translation of short and long ORFs.

Here, it is shown that TAF(II)250, the largest subunit of TFIID, contains two tandem bromodomain modules that bind selectively to multiply acetylated histone H4 peptides. The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of the double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side, four- helix bundles with a highly polarized surface charge distribution. Each bundle contains an N({$\epsilon$})-acetyllysine binding pocket at its center, which results in a structure ideally suited for recognition of diacetylated histone H4 tails. Thus, TFIID may be targeted to specific chromatin-bound promoters and may play a role in chromatin recognition.},

At a characteristic time in development, the primordial germ cells pass across the primordium of the gut and migrate on its outer surface toward the mesoderm, where they eventually associate with the somatic tissues of the gonad. Here we demonstrate that the exit and migration are specific behaviors of the primordial germ cells and that they are controlled by the somatic tissue of the embryo rather than by a germ cell autonomous clock. Using mutations, we show that these controlling somatic events probably occur in the tissue of the gut primordium itself.},

However, mechanisms for coordinating actions of multiple co-regulator proteins are poorly understood. We demonstrate that multiple protein-protein interactions by the protein acetyltransferase TIP60 are required for estrogen-induced transcription of a subset of estrogen receptor alpha (ER{$\alpha$}) target genes in human cells. Estrogen-induced recruitment of TIP60 requires direct binding of TIP60 to ER{$\alpha$} and the action of chromatin-remodeling ATPase BRG1, leading to increased recruitment of histone methyltransferase MLL1 and increased monomethylation of histone H3 at Lys4. TIP60 recruitment also requires preferential binding of the TIP60 chromodomain to histone H3 containing monomethylated Lys4, which marks active and poised enhancer elements. After recruitment, TIP60 increases acetylation of histone H2A at Lys5. Thus, complex cooperation of TIP60 with ER{$\alpha$} and other chromatin-remodeling enzymes is required for estrogen-induced transcription. \textcopyright{} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

  abstract = {Members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, including the ATM, DNA-PKcs, Atr, and Trrap proteins, function in signal transduction pathways that activate the DNA damage response. PIKK proteins contain a conserved C-terminal FAT/kinase domain/FATC domain structure. The FATC domain of ATM mediates the interaction between ATM and Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates activation of ATM. Here, we examined whether the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, and Trrap were also able to interact with Tip60. Deletion of the FATC domain of ATM blocked the interaction between ATM and Tip60 and suppressed the activation of ATM kinase activity by DNA damage. Replacement of the FATC domain of ATM with the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, or Trrap restored the activation of ATM and its association with Tip60. These results indicate that the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, Trrap, and ATM are functionally equivalent. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Tip60 is constitutively associated with DNA-PKcs and that the histone acetyltransferase activity associated with DNA-PKcs is up-regulated by DNA damage. When Tip60 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNA, the activation of DNA-PKcs (measured by autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at serine 2056 and threonine 2609) was inhibited, demonstrating a key role for Tip60 in the activation of DNA-PKcs by DNA damage. The conserved FATC domain of PIKK proteins may therefore function as a binding domain for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. Further, the ability of Tip60 to regulate the activation of both ATM and DNA-PKcs in response to DNA damage demonstrates that Tip60 is a key component of the DNA damage-signaling network. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that ote is required for the Dpp/BMP signaling pathway to silence bam transcription. By structure-function analysis, we demonstrate that the nuclear membrane localization of Ote is essential for its role in GSC maintenance. Finally, we show that Ote physically interacts with Medea/Smad4 at the bam silencer element to regulate GSC fate. Thus, we demonstrate that specific nuclear membrane components mediate signal-dependent transcriptional effects to control stem cell behavior. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Such changes can be introduced by posttranslational modifications of histones, by chromatin remodeling, or by the incorporation of variants of H2A and H3 into nucleosomes. In contrast to the canonical histones, which are deposited behind the replication fork during S phase, histone variants are incorporated in a process that is independent of DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that distinct multiprotein complexes are responsible for the targeted deposition of histone variants at active genes, centromeres and silent loci. The incorporation of histone variants most probably has epigenetic consequences and contributes to architectural changes in chromosomes. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

A second class of loci, collectively known as the trithorax group, plays an antagonistic role as positive regulators of the ANT-C and BX-C genes. Molecular analysis of the E(z) gene predicts a 760-amino-acid protein product. A region of 116 amino acids near the E(z) carboxy terminus is 41.2\% identical (68.4\% similar) with a carboxy-terminal region of the trithorax protein. This portion of the trithorax protein is part of a larger region previously shown to share extensive homology with a human protein (ALL-1/Hrx) that is implicated in acute leukemias. Over this same 116 amino acids, E(z) and ALL-1/Hrx are 43.9\% identical (68.4\% similar). Otherwise, E(z) is not significantly similar to any previously described proteins. As this region of sequence similarity is shared by two proteins with antagonistic functions, we suggest that it may comprise a domain that interacts with a common target, either nucleic acid or protein. Opposite effects on transcription might then be determined by other portions of the two proteins.}

Bromodomain proteins have been identified as integral components of chromatin remodeling complexes and frequently possess histone acetyltransferase activity. Their encoding genes have been identified at translocation breakpoints, and at least one, CBP, is a tumor suppressor gene. We have identified a series of novel bromodomain genes by EST database and cDNA library screening. Comparison of sequences for four clones indicated that they represent genes belonging to a novel bromodomain family. Full-length sequences for these genes, which are widely expressed, predict encoded proteins of between 1527 and 1972 amino acids. In addition to a carboxy- terminal bromodomain, an adjacent PHD finger, and a WACZ motif, at least four other conserved novel motifs are present in each protein. The genes contain regions conserved with Drosophila Acf1 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZK783.4. The novel genes, termed BAZ1A, BAZ1B, BAZ2A, and BAZ2B, localize to chromosomes 14q12-q13, 7q11- q21, 12q24.3-qter, and 2q23-q24, respectively. Conservation of multiple domains throughout these genes with Acf1 indicates that they are likely to be components of chromatin remodeling complexes. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}

Materials \& methods: In breast tumors, H3K4ac enrichment and its link with TIP60 were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and re-chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques. To assess the biological roles of TIP60 in breast cancer, two cell lines of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 (ER-) and MCF-7 (ER+) were transfected with shRNA specifically targeting TIP60 and injected to athymic Balb-c mice. Results: We identified a potential target of TIP60, H3K4. We show that an underexpression of TIP60 could contribute to a reduction of H3K4 acetylation in breast cancer. An increase in tumor development was noted in sh-TIP60 MDA-MB-231 xenografts and a slowdown of tumor growth in sh-TIP60 MCF-7 xenografts. Conclusion: This is evidence that the underexpression of TIP60 observed in breast cancer can promote the tumorigenesis of ER-negative tumors.},

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase II core promoter is generally defined to be the sequence that directs the initiation of transcription. This simple definition belies a diverse and complex transcriptional module. There are two major types of core promoters - focused and dispersed. Focused promoters contain either a single transcription start site or a distinct cluster of start sites over several nucleotides, whereas dispersed promoters contain several start sites over 50-100 nucleotides and are typically found in CpG islands in vertebrates. Focused promoters are more ancient and widespread throughout nature than dispersed promoters; however, in vertebrates, dispersed promoters are more common than focused promoters. In addition, core promoters may contain many different sequence motifs, such as the TATA box, BRE, Inr, MTE, DPE, DCE, and XCPE1, that specify different mechanisms of transcription and responses to enhancers. Thus, the core promoter is a sophisticated gateway to transcription that determines which signals will lead to transcription initiation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase II core promoter is sometimes referred to as the gateway to transcription. The core promoter is generally defined to be the stretch of DNA that directs the initiation of transcription. This simple description belies a complex multidimensional regulatory element, as there is considerable diversity in core promoter structure and function. Core promoters can be viewed at the levels of DNA sequences, transcription factors, and biological networks. Key DNA sequences are known as core promoter elements, which include the TATA box, initiator (Inr), polypyrimidine initiator (TCT), TFIIB recognition element (BRE), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream core promoter element (DPE) motifs. There are no universal core promoter elements that are present in all promoters. Different types of core promoters are transcribed by different sets of transcription factors and exhibit distinct properties, such as specific interactions with transcriptional enhancers, that are determined by the presence or absence of particular core promoter motifs. Moreover, some core promoter elements have been found to be associated with specific biological networks. For instance, the TCT motif is dedicated to the transcription of ribosomal protein genes in Drosophila and humans. In addition, nearly all of the Drosophila Hox genes have a DPE motif in their core promoters. The complexity of the core promoter is further seen in the relation among transcription initiation patterns, the stability or lability of transcriptional states, and the organization of the chromatin structure in the promoter region. Hence, the current data indicate that the core promoter is a critical component in the regulation of gene activity. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

  abstract = {During oocyte growth, chromatin structure is altered globally and gene expression is silenced. To investigate the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of these phenomena, changes in global DNA methylation and in various histone modifications, i.e. acetylation of H3K9, H3K18, H4K5, and H4K12, and methylation of H3K4 and H3K9, were examined during the growth of mouse oocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the signal intensities of all these modifications increased during growth and that fully grown, germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes showed the most modifications. Since acetylation of most of the lysine residues on histones and methylation of H3K4 are associated with active gene expression, the increased levels of these modifications do not seem to be associated with gene silencing in GV-stage oocytes. Given that there are two types of GV-stage oocytes with different chromatin configurations and transcriptional activities, the epigenetic modification statuses of these two types were compared. The levels of all the epigenetic modifications examined were higher in the SN(surrounded nucleolus)-type oocytes, in which highly condensed chromatin is concentrated in the area around the nucleolus and gene expression is silenced than in the NSN (not surrounded nucleolus)-type oocytes, in which less-condensed chromatin does not surround the nucleolus and gene expression is active. In addition, the expression levels of various enzymes that catalyze histone modifications were shown by RT-PCR to increase with oocyte growth. Taken together, the results show that all of the epigenetic modifications increased in a concerted manner during oocyte growth, and suggest that these increases are not associated with gene expression. \textcopyright{} 2007 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.}

GSCs express variant isoforms of general transcriptional components, translation initiation factors, and several variant ribosomal proteins, including RpL22, a protein enriched in several mammalian stem cells. These novel isoforms may help regulate stem cell gene expression because a reversion assay indicated that at least four were specific for GSCs. By comparative analysis, we identify additional genes enriched in GSCs, including Psc, the Drosophila homolog of the Bmi-1 Polycomb group gene, as well as genes that may delay cytokinesis in pre-meiotic germ cells. By comparing GSCs arrested by BMP over-expression and bam mutation, we hypothesize that mRNA utilization is modulated in differentiating GSC daughters. Our findings suggest that Drosophila and mammalian stem cells utilize at least two regulatory mechanisms in common.},

  abstract = {Acetylation and other modifications on histones comprise histone codes that govern transcriptional regulatory processes in chromatin. Yet little is known how different histone codes are translated and put into action. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that bromodomain-containing proteins recognize different patterns of acetylated histones in intact nuclei of living cells. The bromodomain protein Brd2 selectively interacted with acetylated lysine 12 on histone H4, whereas TAFII250 and PCAF recognized H3 and other acetylated histones, indicating fine specificity of histone recognition by different bromodomains. This hierarchy of interactions was also seen in direct peptide binding assays. Interaction with acetylated histone was essential for Brd2 to amplify transcription. Moreover association of Brd2, but not other bromodomain proteins, with acetylated chromatin persisted on chromosomes during mitosis. Thus the recognition of histone acetylation code by bromodomains is selective, is involved in transcription, and potentially conveys transcriptional memory across cell divisions.}

Prior studies revealed that the basic leucine zipper domain (b-ZIP) of transcription factor ATF-2 (also called CRE-BP1) can interact with the CBP HAT domain. In this study, we have examined the ATF-2 b-ZIP interaction with the p300 HAT domain and shown that p300 HAT autoacetylation can enhance the binding affinity. Pull-down assays revealed that hyperacetylated p300 HAT is more efficiently retained by immobilized ATF-2 b-ZIP than hypoacetylated p300 HAT. Loop deleted p300 HAT lacking autoacetylation was retained about as well as hyperacetylated p300 HAT, suggesting that the loop and ATF-2 compete for p300 HAT binding. While ATF-2 b-ZIP is a weak inhibitor of hypoacetylated p300 HAT acetylation of a histone H4 peptide, hyperacetylated p300 HAT is much more potently inhibited by ATF-2 b-ZIP. Moreover, we showed that ATF-2 b-ZIP could serve as an acetyltransferase substrate for p300 HAT. Using mass spectrometry, two p300 HAT lysine acetylation sites were mapped in ATF-2 b-ZIP. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody revealed that ATF-2 can undergo reversible acetylation in vivo. Mutational analysis of the two ATF-2 b-ZIP acetylation sites revealed their potential contributions to ATF-2-mediated transcriptional activation. Taken together, these studies suggest multiple roles for protein acetylation in the regulation of transcription by p300/CBP and ATF-2. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

The objective of the study was to investigate the regulation of meiosis-associated and male germ cell-related genes, stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (STRA8), synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3), dosage suppressor of mck1 (DMC1), doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) and deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) following exogenous administration of retinoic acid (RA) and after the modulation of endogenous RA by a cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 inhibitor (CYP26B1-I; R115866) in an in vitro testis model. Testicles of five healthy, medium-sized and mixed-breed dogs were used for the organotypic cultures. All-trans-RA at 2 {$\mu$}m, CYP26B1-I at 1 {$\mu$}m and the control dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were administered to the testes cultures, and the cultures were maintained for 24 h. Genes STRA8, DAZL and DMRT1 were significantly up-regulated as a result of the direct and indirect increase in the RA levels in the testis, subsequent to the exogenous administration of all-trans-RA and CYP26B1 inhibitor. Up-regulation of STRA8 was very prominent compared to DAZL and DMRT, and the drastic up-regulation of STRA8 was also observed with CY26B1-I than with all-trans-RA. No significant differences were found with the early meiotic markers, SYCP3 and DMC1 with RA, CY26B1-I and vehicle treatments. Because DAZL encodes a germ cell-specific RNA-binding protein, required for the induction of STRA8 and initiation of meiosis, we might see the expression differences temporally with the stage of spermatogenesis. DMRT1 is a unique gonad- and stage-specific transcription factor, directly activates STRA8 and has the temporal influence on its expression. Protein expression of DAZL and STRA8 was greater in RA- and CYP26B1-I-treated testis culture, whereas DMRT1 showed greater protein expression for RA treatment, but not for CYP26B1-I treatment compared to control. Relative protein expression of STRA8 was greatest for the CYP26B1-I treatment compared to DMSO and RA treatments. In conclusion, pharmacological intervention of spermatogenesis pertinent to RA signalling is plausible, and the effect of modulation differs upon the types of molecules and the key stages of signalling being targeted. \textcopyright{} 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.}

  abstract = {Study of Drosophila oogenesis reveals that the nuclear localization of actin is controlled by both development and Fascin. Fascin regulates both endogenous nuclear actin and ectopic nuclear actin rod formation by controlling Cofilin., Drosophila oogenesis provides a developmental system with which to study nuclear actin. During Stages 5\textendash 9, nuclear actin levels are high in the oocyte and exhibit variation within the nurse cells. Cofilin and Profilin, which regulate the nuclear import and export of actin, also localize to the nuclei. Expression of GFP-tagged Actin results in nuclear actin rod formation. These findings indicate that nuclear actin must be tightly regulated during oogenesis. One factor mediating this regulation is Fascin. Overexpression of Fascin enhances nuclear GFP-Actin rod formation, and Fascin colocalizes with the rods. Loss of Fascin reduces, whereas overexpression of Fascin increases, the frequency of nurse cells with high levels of nuclear actin, but neither alters the overall nuclear level of actin within the ovary. These data suggest that Fascin regulates the ability of specific cells to accumulate nuclear actin. Evidence indicates that Fascin positively regulates nuclear actin through Cofilin. Loss of Fascin results in decreased nuclear Cofilin. In addition, Fascin and Cofilin genetically interact, as double heterozygotes exhibit a reduction in the number of nurse cells with high nuclear actin levels. These findings are likely applicable beyond Drosophila follicle development, as the localization and functions of Fascin and the mechanisms regulating nuclear actin are widely conserved.},

  abstract = {The yeast histone deacetylase Rpd3 can be recruited to promoters to repress transcription initiation. Biochemical, genetic, and gene-expression analyses show that Rpd3 exists in two distinct complexes. The smaller complex, Rpd3C(S), shares Sin3 and Ume1 with Rpd3C(L) but contains the unique subunits Rco1 and Eaf3. Rpd3C(S) mutants exhibit phenotypes remarkably similar to those of Set2, a histone methyltransferase associated with elongating RNA polymerase II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and biochemical experiments indicate that the chromodomain of Eaf3 recruits Rpd3C(S) to nucleosomes methylated by Set2 on histone H3 lysine 36, leading to deacetylation of transcribed regions. This pathway apparently acts to negatively regulate transcription because deleting the genes for Set2 or Rpd3C(S) bypasses the requirement for the positive elongation factor Bur1/Bur2.

  abstract = {C. elegans germline stem cells exist within a stem cell pool that is maintained by a single-celled mesenchymal niche and Notch signaling. Downstream of Notch signaling, a regulatory network governs stem cells and differentiation. Central to that network is the FBF RNA-binding protein, a member of the widely conserved PUF family that functions by either of two broadly conserved mechanisms to repress its target mRNAs. Without FBF, germline stem cells do not proliferate and they do not maintain their na\"ive, undifferentiated state. Therefore, FBF is a pivotal regulator of germline self-renewal. Validated FBF targets include several key differentiation regulators as well as a major cell cycle regulator. A genomic analysis identifies many other developmental and cell cycle regulators as likely FBF targets and suggests that FBF is a broad-spectrum regulator of the genome with {$>$}1,000 targets. A comparison of the FBF target list with similar lists for human PUF proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, reveals {$\sim$}200 shared targets. The FBF hub works within a network controlling self-renewal vs. differentiation. This network consists of classical developmental cell fate regulators and classical cell cycle regulators. Recent results have begun to integrate developmental and cell cycle regulation within the network. The molecular dynamics of the network remain a challenge for the future, but models are proposed. We suggest that molecular controls of C. elegans germline stem cells provide an important model for controls of stem cells more broadly.},

In contrast, the germ line of either a male or a hermaphrodite carrying a mutation of the fog-1 (feminization of the germ line) locus is sexually transformed: cells that would normally make sperm differentiate as oocytes. However, the somatic tissues of fog-1 mutants remain unaffected. All fog-1 alleles identified confer the same phenotype. The fog-1 mutations appear to reduce fog-1 function, indicating that the wild-type fog-1 product is required for specification of a germ cell as a spermatocyte. Two lines of evidence indicate that a germ cell is determined for sex at about the same time that it enters meiosis. These include the fog-1 temperature sensitive period, which coincides in each sex with first entry into meiosis, and the phenotype of a fog-1; glp-1 double mutant. Experiments with double mutants show that fog-1 is epistatic to mutations in all other sex-determining genes tested. These results lead to the conclusion that fog-1 acts at the same level as the fem genes at the end of the sex determination pathway to specify germ cells as sperm.}

The RNA-binding translational repressor Pumilio (Pum) in conjunction with Nanos (Nos) is required for self-renewal, whereas Bam (bag-of-marbles) and Bgcn (benign gonial cell neoplasm) promote differentiation of germ line stem cells in the Drosophila ovary. Genetic analysis suggests that Bam and Bgcn antagonize Pum/Nos function to promote differentiation; however, the molecular basis of this epistatic relationship is currently unknown. Here, we show that Bam and Bgcn inhibit Pum function through direct binding. We identified a ternary complex involving Bam, Bgcn, and Pum in which Bam, but not Bgcn, directly interacts with Pum, and this interaction is greatly increased by the presence of Bgcn. In a heterologous reporter assay to monitor Pum activity, Bam, but not Bgcn, inhibits Pum activity. Notably, the N-terminal region of Pum, which lacks the C-terminal RNA-binding Puf domain, mediates both the ternary protein interaction and the Bam inhibition of Pum function. These studies suggest that, in cystoblasts, Bam and Bgcn may directly inhibit Pum/Nos activity to promote differentiation of germ line stem cells. \textcopyright{} 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

The functional significance of these changes and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here we show that Setdb1, a lysine methyltransferase, controls the global level of histone H3 lysine 9 di-methyl (H3K9me2) mark in growing oocytes. Conditional deletion of Setdb1 in developing oocytes leads to meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle and meiosis I stages, resulting in substantially fewer mature eggs. Embryos derived from these eggs exhibit severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. Rescue experiments by expressing wild-type or inactive Setdb1 in Setdb1-deficient oocytes suggest that the catalytic activity of Setdb1 is essential for meiotic progression and early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, up-regulation of Cdc14b, a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression, greatly contributes to the meiotic arrest phenotype. Setdb1 deficiency also leads to derepression of transposons and increased DNA damage in oocytes, which likely also contribute to meiotic defects. Thus, Setdb1 is a maternal-effect gene that controls meiotic progression and is essential for early embryogenesis. Our results uncover an important link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway governing meiotic progression., During oogenesis, oocytes accumulate transcripts and proteins that support meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis. Although a number of such maternal-effect factors have been identified, our knowledge about the molecular machinery that drives meiotic progression and maternal-to-zygotic transition is still limited. In particular, the functional significance of epigenetic changes, which accompany meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis, and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here, we identify Setdb1, a lysine methyltransferase specific for the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, as a maternal-effect factor that is essential for meiotic progression in oocytes and mitotic cell divisions in early embryos in mouse. We show that Setdb1 is highly expressed in growing oocytes and directly represses the expression Cdc14b, a phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression. Setdb1 is also required to repress retrotransposons and maintain genomic stability in oocytes. Embryos derived from Setdb1-depleted oocytes show severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. The roles of Setdb1 in meiotic progression and preimplantation development require its catalytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that Setdb1 is an important regulator of Cdc14b, thus uncovering a molecular link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway that drives meiotic progression.},

These TSSs were clustered into 30,964 clusters that were separated from each other by more than 500 bp and thus are very likely to constitute mutually distinct alternative promoters. To our surprise, at least 7674 (52\%) human RefSeq genes were subject to regulation by putative alternative promoters (PAPs). On average, there were 3.1 PAPs per gene, with the composition of one CpG-island-containing promoter per 2.6 CpG-less promoters. In 17\% of the PAP-containing loci, tissue-specific use of the PAPs was observed. The richest tissue sources of the tissue-specific PAPs were testis and brain. It was also intriguing that the PAP-containing promoters were enriched in the genes encoding signal transduction-related proteins and were rarer in the genes encoding extracellular proteins, possibly reflecting the varied functional requirement for and the restricted expression of those categories of genes, respectively. The patterns of the first exons were highly diverse as well. On average, there were 7.7 different splicing types of first exons per locus partly produced by the PAPs, suggesting that a wide variety of transcripts can be achieved by this mechanism. Our findings suggest that use of alternate promoters and consequent alternative use of first exons should play a pivotal role in generating the complexity required for the highly elaborated molecular systems in humans. \textcopyright 2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

Here we report that the histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) specific histone acetyltransferase MOF displays differential binding behavior depending on whether the target gene is located on the X chromosome versus the autosomes. More specifically, on the male X chromosome, where MSL1 and MSL3 are preferentially associated with the 3{${'}$} end of dosage compensated genes, MOF displays a bimodal distribution binding to promoters and the 3{${'}$} ends of genes. In contrast, on MSL1/MSL3 independent X-linked genes and autosomal genes in males and females, MOF binds primarily to promoters. Binding of MOF to autosomes is functional, as H4K16 acetylation and the transcription levels of a number of genes are affected upon MOF depletion. Therefore, MOF is not only involved in the onset of dosage compensation, but also acts as a regulator of gene expression in the Drosophila genome. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To address this and to identify the steps of the NPC disassembly and assembly, we investigated Drosophila embryo nuclear structure at the syncytial stage of early development using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), a high resolution surface imaging technique, and transmission electron microscopy. Nuclear division in syncytial embryos is characterized by semi-closed mitosis, during which the nuclear membranes are ruptured only at the polar regions and are arranged into an inner double membrane surrounded by an additional `spindle envelope'. FESEM analysis of the steps of this process as viewed on the surface of the dividing nucleus confirm our previous in vitro model for the assembly of the NPCs via a series of structural intermediates, showing for the first time a temporal progression from one intermediate to the next. Nascent NPCs initially appear to form at the site of fusion between the mitotic nuclear envelope and the overlying spindle membrane. A model for NPC disassembly is offered that starts with the release of the central transporter and the removal of the cytoplasmic ring subunits before the star ring.},

In particular, the histone H3 lysine 36 (K36) methyltransferase Set2 has recently been shown to associate with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), implying that this enzyme has an important role in the transcription elongation process. Here we show that a novel domain in the C terminus of Set2 is responsible for interaction between Set2 and RNAPII. This domain, termed the Set2 Rpb1 interacting (SRI) domain, is encompassed by amino acid residues 619 to 718 in Set2 and is found to occur in a number of putative Set2 homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans. Unexpectedly, BIACORE analysis reveals that the SRI domain binds specifically, and with high affinity, to CTD repeats that are doubly modified (serine 2 and serine 5 phosphorylated), indicating that Set2 association across the body of genes requires a specific pattern of phosphorylated RNAPII. Deletion of the SRI domain not only abolishes Set2-RNAPII interaction but also abolishes K36 methylation in vivo, indicating that this interaction is required for establishing K36 methylation on chromatin. Using 6-azauracil (6AU) as an indicator of transcription elongation defects, we found that deletion of the SRI domain conferred a strong resistance to this compound, which was identical to that observed with set2 deletion mutants. Furthermore, yeast strains carrying set2 alleles that are catalytically inactive or yeast strains bearing point mutations at K36 were also found to be resistant to 6AU. These data suggest that it is the methylation by Set2 that affects transcription elongation. In agreement with this, we have determined that deletion of SET2, its SRI domain, or amino acid substitutions at K36 result in an alteration of RNAPII occupancy levels over transcribing genes. Taken together, these data indicate K36 methylation, established by the SRI domain-mediated association of Set2 with RNAPII, plays an important role in the transcription elongation process.},

  abstract = {The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B regulates gene transcription and cell differentiation and is implicated in carcinogenesis. It contains multiple conserved chromatin-associated domains, including three PHD fingers of unknown function. Here, we show that the first and third, but not the second, PHD fingers of KDM5B possess histone binding activities. The PHD1 finger is highly specific for unmodified histone H3 (H3K4me0), whereas the PHD3 finger shows preference for the trimethylated histone mark H3K4me3. RNA-seq analysis indicates that KDM5B functions as a transcriptional repressor for genes involved in inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Biochemical analysis reveals that KDM5B associates with components ofthe nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and may cooperate with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in gene repression. KDM5B is downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer relative to estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of KDM5B in the MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells suppresses cell migration and invasion, and the PHD1-H3K4me0 interaction is essential for inhibiting migration. These findings highlight tumor-suppressive functions of KDM5B in triple-negative breast cancer cells and suggest a multivalent mechanism for KDM5B-mediated transcriptional regulation. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.}

  abstract = {The epigenetic regulation of gene expression by the covalent modification of histones is a fundamental mechanism required for the proper differentiation of germ line cells during development. Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) leads to chromatin silencing and the formation of heterochromatin by recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). dSETDB1/Eggless (Egg), the ortholog of the human methyltransferase SETDB1, is the only essential H3K9 methyltransferase in Drosophila and is required for H3K9 trimethylation in the female germ line. Here we show that Windei (Wde), the Drosophila homolog of mouse mAM and human MCAF1, is an essential cofactor of Egg required for its nuclear localization and function in female germ line cells. By deletion analysis combined with coimmunoprecipitation, we have identified the protein regions in Wde and Egg that are necessary and sufficient for the interaction between the two proteins. We furthermore identified a region of Egg that gets covalently modified by SUMOylation, which may facilitate the formation of higher order chromatin-modifying complexes. Together with Egg, Wde localizes to euchromatin, is enriched on chromosome 4, and binds to the Painting of fourth (POF) protein. Our data provide the first genetic and phenotypic analysis of a mAM/MCAF1 homolog in a model organism and demonstrate its essential function in the survival of germ line cells.},

To advance our understanding of the genetic regulatory hierarchies controlling this tissue response, we have isolated and characterized a gene, EcR, for a new steroid receptor homolog and have shown that it encodes an ecdysone receptor. First, EcR protein binds active ecdysteroids and is antigenically indistinguishable from the ecdysone-binding protein previously observed in extracts of Drosophila cell lines and tissues. Second, EcR protein binds DNA with high specificity at ecdysone response elements. Third, ecdysone-responsive cultured cells express EcR, whereas ecdysone-resistant cells derived from them are deficient in EcR. Expression of EcR in such resistant cells by transfection restores their ability to respond to the hormone. As expected, EcR is nuclear and found in all ecdysone target tissues examined. Furthermore, the EcR gene is expressed at each developmental stage marked by a pulse of ecdysone. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

To provide a framework for the analysis of chromatin function in Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated a genome-wide map of histone H3 tail methylations. We find that C. elegans genes show distributions of histone modifications that are similar to those of other organisms, with H3K4me3 near transcription start sites, H3K36me3 in the body of genes and H3K9me3 enriched on silent genes. We also observe a novel pattern: exons are preferentially marked with H3K36me3 relative to introns. H3K36me3 exon marking is dependent on transcription and is found at lower levels in alternatively spliced exons, supporting a splicing-related marking mechanism. We further show that the difference in H3K36me3 marking between exons and introns is evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse. We propose that H3K36me3 exon marking in chromatin provides a dynamic link between transcription and splicing. \textcopyright{} 2009 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The largest subunit of Pol II contains a repetitive carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that becomes highly phosphorylated during transcription. mRNA-capping enzyme binds only to phosphorylated CTD, whereas other processing factors may bind to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. Capping occurs soon after transcription initiation and before other processing events, raising the question of whether capping components remain associated with the transcription complex after they have modified the 5' end of the mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that capping enzyme cross-links to promoters but not coding regions. In contrast, the mRNA cap methyltransferase and the Hrp1/CFIB polyadenylation factor cross-link to both promoter and coding regions. Remarkably, the phosphorylation pattern of the CTD changes during transcription. Ser 5 phosphorylation is detected primarily at promoter regions dependent on TFIIH. In contrast, Ser 2 phosphorylation is seen only in coding regions. These results suggest a dynamic association of mRNA processing factors with differently modified forms of the polymerase throughout the transcription cycle.},

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains many duplicated genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Prior studies have suggested that these duplicated proteins are functionally redundant and affect cellular processes in proportion to their expression. In contrast, through studies of ASH1 mRNA in yeast, we demonstrate paralog-specific requirements for the translation of localized mRNAs. Intriguingly, these paralog-specific effects are limited to a distinct subset of duplicated ribosomal proteins. Moreover, transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of cells lacking specific ribosomal proteins reveals differences between the functional roles of ribosomal protein paralogs that extend beyond effects on mRNA localization. Finally, we show that ribosomal protein paralogs exhibit differential requirements for assembly and localization. Together, our data indicate complex specialization of ribosomal proteins for specific cellular processes and support the existence of a ribosomal code. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we identify mutations of the Ribosomal Protein L38 (Rpl38) gene in mice exhibiting surprising tissue-specific patterning defects, including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton. In Rpl38 mutant embryos, global protein synthesis is unchanged; however the translation of a select subset of Homeobox mRNAs is perturbed. Our data reveal that RPL38 facilitates 80S complex formation on these mRNAs as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer transcript-specific translational control. We further show that Rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where loss-of-function phenotypes occur. Unexpectedly, a ribosomal protein (RP) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo. Collectively, these findings suggest that RP activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development.Copyright \{\textcopyright\} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {In mammals, meiosis is initiated at different time points in males and females, but the mechanism underlying this difference is unknown. Female germ cells begin meiosis during embryogenesis. In males, embryonic germ cells undergo G0/G1 mitotic cell cycle arrest, and meiosis begins after birth. In mice, the Stimulated by Retinoic Acid Gene 8 (Stra8) has been found to be required for the transition into meiosis in both female and male germ cells. Stra8 is expressed in embryonic ovaries just before meiotic initiation, whereas its expression in testes is first detected after birth. Here we examine the mechanism underlying the sex-specific timing of Stra8 expression and meiotic initiation in mice. Our work shows that signaling by retinoic acid (RA), an active derivative of vitamin A, is required for Stra8 expression and thereby meiotic initiation in embryonic ovaries. We also discovered that RA is sufficient to induce Stra8 expression in embryonic testes and in vitamin A-deficient adult testes in vivo. Finally, our results show that cytochrome p450 (CYP)-mediated RA metabolism prevents premature StraS expression in embryonic testes. Treatment with an inhibitor specific to RA-metabolizing enzymes indicates that a cytochrome p450 from the 26 family (CYP26) is responsible for delaying Sfra8 expression in embryonic testes. Sex-specific regulation of RA signaling thus plays an essential role in meiotic initiation in embryonic ovaries and precludes its occurrence in embryonic testes. Because RA signaling regulates Stra8 expression in both embryonic ovaries and adult testes, this portion of the meiotic initiation pathway may be identical in both sexes. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Background: The Caenorhabditis elegans FBF protein and its Drosophila relative, Pumilio, define a large family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. By binding regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of their cognate RNAs, FBF and Pumilio have key post-transcriptional roles in early developmental decisions. In C. elegans, FBF is required for repression of fem-3 mRNA to achieve the hermaphrodite switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis. Results: We report here that FBF and NANOS-3 (NOS-3), one of three C. elegans Nanos homologs, interact with each other in both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro assays. We have delineated the portions of each protein required for this interaction. Worms lacking nanos function were derived either by RNA-mediated interference (nos-1 and nos-2) or by use of a deletion mutant (nos-3). The roles of the three nos genes overlap during germ-line development. In certain nos-deficient animals, the hermaphrodite sperm-oocyte switch was defective, leading to the production of excess sperm and no oocytes. In other nos-deficient animals, the entire germ line died during larval development. This germ-line death did not require CED-3, a protease required for apoptosis. Conclusions: The data suggest that NOS-3 participates in the sperm-oocyte switch through its physical interaction with FBF, forming a regulatory complex that controls fem-3 mRNA. NOS-1 and NOS-2 also function in the switch, but do not interact directly with FBF. The three C. elegans nanos genes, like Drosophila nanos, are also critical for germ-line survival. We propose that this may have been the primitive function of nanos genes.},

While m6As can have direct effects on the structure, maturation, or translation of mRNAs, such modifications can also influence the fate of RNAs via proteins termed "readers" that specifically recognize and bind modified nucleotides. Several YTH domain-containing proteins have been identified as m6A readers that regulate the splicing, translation, or stability of specific mRNAs. In contrast to the other YTH domain-containing proteins, YTHDC2 has several defined domains and here, we have analyzed the contribution of these domains to the RNA and protein interactions of YTHDC2. The YTH domain of YTHDC2 preferentially binds m6A-containing RNAs via a conserved hydrophobic pocket, whereas the ankyrin repeats mediate an RNA-independent interaction with the 5{${'}$}-3{${'}$} exoribonuclease XRN1. We show that the YTH and R3H domains contribute to the binding of YTHDC2 to cellular RNAs, and using crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), we reveal that YTHDC2 interacts with the small ribosomal subunit in close proximity to the mRNA entry/ exit sites. YTHDC2 was recently found to promote a "fast-track" expression program for specific mRNAs, and our data suggest that YTHDC2 accomplishes this by recruitment of the RNA degradation machinery to regulate the stability of m6A-containing mRNAs and by utilizing its distinct RNA-binding domains to bridge interactions between m6A-containing mRNAs and the ribosomes to facilitate their efficient translation.},

The Fcp1 CTD phosphatase catalyzes dephosphorylation of S2-P. Here, we report that Ssu72, a component of the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex, is a CTD phosphatase with specificity for S5-P. Ssu72 catalyzes CTD S5-P dephosphorylation in association with the Pta1 component of the CPF complex, although its essential role in 3{${'}$} end processing is independent of catalytic activity. Depletion of Ssu72 impairs transcription in vitro, and this defect can be rescued by recombinant, catalytically active Ssu72. We propose that Ssu72 has a dual role in transcription, one as a CTD S5-P phosphatase that regenerates the initiation-competent, hypophosphorylated form of RNAP II and the other as a factor necessary for cleavage of pre-mRNA and efficient transcription termination.}

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that Set2 and histone H3 Lys36 methylation are associated with the coding regions of several genes that were tested and correlate with active transcription. Both depend, as well, on the Paf1 elongation factor complex. The C terminus of Set2, which contains a WW domain, is also required for effective Lys36 methylation. Deletion of CTK1, encoding an RNAPII CTD kinase, prevents Lys36 methylation and Set2 recruitment, suggesting that methylation may be triggered by contact of the WW domain or C terminus of Set2 with Ser2-phosphorylated CTD. A set2 deletion results in slight sensitivity to 6-azauracil and much less beta-galactosidase produced by a reporter plasmid, resulting from a defect in transcription. In synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, synthetic growth defects were obtained when a set2 deletion was combined with deletions of all five components of the Paf1 complex, the chromodomain elongation factor Chd1, the putative elongation factor Soh1, the Bre1 or Lge1 components of the histone H2B ubiquitination complex, or the histone H2A variant Htz1.

Our results show that PNG kinase is a critical regulator of the extensive changes in the translatome, acting uniquely at this developmental window. Analysis of the proteome in png mutants provided insights into the contributions of translation to changes in protein levels, revealing a compensatory dynamic between translation and protein turnover during proteome remodeling at the return to totipotency. The proteome changes additionally suggested regulators of meiosis and early embryogenesis, including the conserved H3K4 demethylase LID, which we demonstrated is required during this period despite transcriptional inactivity. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.}

This decondensation is mediated through chromatin-remodeling complex PBAP, as PBAP is both robustly recruited by Sec13 and required for Sec13-induced decondensation. This phenomenon is not correlated with localization of the target locus to the nuclear periphery, but is correlated with robust recruitment of Nup Elys. Furthermore, we identified a biochemical interaction between endogenous Sec13 and Elys with PBAP, and a role for endogenous Elys in global as well as gene-specific chromatin decompaction. Together, these findings reveal a functional role and mechanism for specific nuclear pore components in promoting an open chromatin state.},

Intriguingly, several HATs have been shown an ability to acetylate nonhistone protein substrates (e.g., transcription factors) in vitro as well, suggesting the possibility that internal lysine acetylation of multiple proteins exists as a rapid and reversible regulatory mechanism much like protein phosphorylation. This article reviews recent developments in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation. We also discuss several important, yet unanswered, questions.}

GNAT complexes from yeast to humans share several conserved subunits, such as Ada2, Ada3, Spt3, and Tra1/TRRAP. We have characterized these factors in Drosophila and found that the flies have two distinct Ada2 variants (dAda2a and dAda2b). Using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches we demonstrate that only one of the two Drosophila Ada2 homologues, dAda2b, is a component of Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complexes. The other Ada2 variant, dAda2a, can associate with dGcn5 but is not incorporated into dSAGA-type complexes. This is the first example of a complex-specific association of the Ada-type transcriptional adapter proteins with GNATs. In addition, dAda2a is part of Gcn5-independent complexes, which are concentrated at transcriptionally active regions on polytene chromosomes. This implicates novel functions for dAda2a in transcription. Humans and mice also possess two Ada2 variants with high homology to dAda2a and dAda2b, respectively. This suggests that the mammalian and fly homologues of the transcriptional adapter Ada2 form two functionally distinct subgroups with unique characteristics.},

We examined the properties of sequences that can function as a DPE as well as the range of promoters that use the DPE as a core promoter element. By using an in vitro transcription assay, we identified 17 new DPE-dependent promoters and found that all possessed identical spacing between the Inr and DPE. Moreover, mutational analysis indicated that the insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide between the Inr and DPE causes a reduction in transcriptional activity and TFIID binding. To explore the range of sequences that can function as a DPE, we constructed and analyzed randomized promoter libraries. These experiments yielded the DPE functional range set, which represents sequences that contribute to or are compatible with DPE function. We then analyzed the DPE functional range set in conjunction with a Drosophila core promoter database that we compiled from 205 promoters with accurately mapped start sites. Somewhat surprisingly, the DPE sequence motif is as common as the TATA box in Drosophila promoters. There is, in addition, a striking adherence of Inr sequences to the Inr consensus in DPE-containing promoters relative to DPE-less promoters. Furthermore, statistical and biochemical analyses indicated that a G nucleotide between the Inr and DPE contributes to transcription from DPE-containing promoters. Thus, these data reveal that the DPE exhibits a strict spacing requirement yet some sequence flexibility and appears to be as widely used as the TATA box in Drosophila.},

In flies, it is involved in the regulation of X-chromosomal and autosomal genes as part of the MSL and the NSL complexes, respectively. While the function of the MSL complex as a dosage compensation regulator is fairly well understood, the role of the NSL complex in gene regulation is still poorly characterized. Here we report a comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex members (NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2) throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Strikingly, the majority (85.5\%) of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. We find that an increased abundance of the histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions is characteristic of NSL-targeted genes. Furthermore, we show that these genes have a well-defined nucleosome free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. Finally, by performing ChIP-seq analyses of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in NSL1- and NSL3-depleted cells, we demonstrate that both NSL proteins are required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to NSL target gene promoters. The observed Pol II reduction coincides with compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters, indicating that the NSL complex is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation complex on target genes. Moreover, genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication-related Element (DRE). Taken together, our findings show that the MOF-containing NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription. \textcopyright{} 2012 Lam et al.}

The mitotic region is smaller than normal in fbf-1 mutants but larger than normal in fbf-2 mutants. Consistent with gene-specific roles, fbf-2 expression is limited to the distal germline, while fbf-1 expression is broader. The fbf-2 gene, but apparently not fbf-1, is controlled by GLP-1/Notch signaling, and the abundance of FBF-1 and FBF-2 proteins is limited by reciprocal 3{${'}$}UTR repression.

In comparison to the signalling pathway itself, however, the molecular targets of the checkpoint that control meiotic progression are not well understood in metazoans. In Drosophila, activation of the meiotic checkpoint is known to prevent formation of the karyosome, a meiosis-specific organisation of chromosomes, but the molecular pathway by which this occurs remains to be identified. Here we show that the conserved kinase NHK-1 (Drosophila Vrk-1) is a crucial meiotic regulator controlled by the meiotic checkpoint. An nhk-1 mutation, whilst resulting in karyosome defects, does so independent of meiotic checkpoint activation. Rather, we find unrepaired DNA breaks formed during recombination suppress NHK-1 activity (inferred from the phosphorylation level of one of its substrates) through the meiotic checkpoint. Additionally DNA breaks induced by X-rays in cultured cells also suppress NHK-1 kinase activity. Unrepaired DNA breaks in oocytes also delay other NHK-1 dependent nuclear events, such as synaptonemal complex disassembly and condensin loading onto chromosomes. Therefore we propose that NHK-1 is a crucial regulator of meiosis and that the meiotic checkpoint suppresses NHK-1 activity to prevent oocyte nuclear reorganisation until DNA breaks are repaired. \textcopyright{} 2010 Lancaster et al.}

  abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis requires dynamic changes in chromatin organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, upon completion of recombination, meiotic chromosomes form a single, compact cluster called the karyosome in an enlarged oocyte nucleus. This clustering is also found in humans; however, the mechanisms underlying karyosome formation are not understood. In this study, we report that phosphorylation of barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) by the conserved kinase nucleosomal histone kinase-1 (NHK-1; Drosophila Vrk1) has a critical function in karyosome formation. We find that the noncatalytic domain of NHK-1 is crucial for its kinase activity toward BAF, a protein that acts as a linker between chromatin and the nuclear envelope. A reduction of NHK-1 or expression of nonphosphorylatable BAF results in ectopic association of chromosomes with the nuclear envelope in oocytes. We propose that BAF phosphorylation by NHK-1 disrupts anchorage of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, allowing karyosome formation in oocytes. These data provide the first mechanistic insight into how the karyosome forms. \textcopyright{} The Rockefeller University Press.}

DNA damage interferes with vital processes such as transcription and replication, and if not repaired properly, can ultimately lead to premature aging and cancer. Multiple DNA pathways signaling for DNA repair and DNA damage collectively safeguard the integrity of DNA. Chromatin plays a pivotal role in regulating DNA-associated processes, and is itself subject to regulation by the DNA-damage response. Chromatin influences access to DNA, and often serves as a docking or signaling site for repair and signaling proteins. Its structure can be adapted by post-translational histone modifications and nucleosome remodeling, catalyzed by the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. In recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes play important, although poorly characterized, roles in facilitating the effectiveness of the DNA-damage response. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the involvement of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in three major DNA repair pathways: nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, and non-homologous end-joining. This shows that a surprisingly large number of different remodeling complexes display pleiotropic functions during different stages of the DNA-damage response. Moreover, several complexes seem to have multiple functions, and are implicated in various mechanistically distinct repair pathways. \textcopyright{} 2012 Lans et al.}

Analysis of the effect of orb mutants on the distribution of RNAs known to be required for oocyte differentiation and polarity suggests that orb functions in RNA localization at multiple points during oogenesis. In addition, phenotypic characterization of the orb mutants indicates that the gene is required early in oogenesis for formation of the 16-cell cyst. It then functions in the differentiation of the oocyte and is required for the three-dimensional reorganization of the germ cells in the cysts as well as for the establishment of normal germ- line-soma interactions in the egg chamber.},

In set2 mutant males, MSL complex maintains X specificity but exhibits reduced binding to target genes. Furthermore, recombinant MSL3 protein preferentially binds nucleosomes marked by H3K36me3 in vitro.

We report that binary interactions between NPC subunits can be established during translation, in the cytoplasm. Strikingly, the nucleoporins Nup1/Nup2, together with a number of nuclear proteins, are instead translated at nuclear pores, through a mechanism involving interactions between their nascent N-termini and nuclear transport receptors. Uncoupling this co-translational recruitment further triggers the formation of cytoplasmic foci of unassembled polypeptides. Altogether, our data reveal that distinct, spatially segregated modes of co-translational interactions foster the ordered assembly of NPC subunits and that localized translation can ensure the proper delivery of proteins to the pore and the nucleus.},

In Drosophila males, the ribonucleoprotein Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex plays an important role in hyperactivation of the X-linked genes to equalize gene dosage differences between the sexes. It appears that X chromosome recognition by the MSL complex may be mediated through a combination of sequence-specificity and transcriptional activities. The resulting transcriptional up-regulation also seems to involve several mechanisms, encompassing both gene-specific and chromosome-wide approaches. Interestingly the histone H4 lysine 16 specific MOF histone acetyl transferase, a key MSL member that hyper-acetylates the male X chromosome, is also involved in gene regulation beyond dosage compensation. A comparison of Drosophila and mammalian systems reveals intriguing parallels in MOF behavior, and highlights the multidisciplinary nature of this enzyme. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

The cystoblast produces a syncytial cluster of 16 cells by precisely four mitotic divisions and incomplete cytokinesis. Mutations in genes required for cystoblast differentiation, such as bag-of-marbles, block syncytial cluster formation and produce a distinctive 'tumorous' or hyperplastic germ cell phenotype. In this paper, we compare the oogenic phenotype of benign gonial cell neoplasm mutations to that of mutations in bam. The data indicate that, like bam, bgcn is required for cystoblast development and that germ cells lacking bgcn become trapped in a stem cell- like state. One indication that germ cells lacking bgcn cannot form cystoblasts is that bgcn stem cells resist genetic ablation by Bam misexpression. Misexpression of Bam eliminates wild-type stem cells, apparently by inducing them to divide as cystoblasts, bgcn stem cells remain active when Bam is misexpressed, probably because they cannot adopt the cystoblast fate. Bgcn activity is not required for Bam protein expression but is essential for the localization of Bam protein to the fusome. Together, the results suggest that Bam and Bgcn cooperatively regulate cystoblast differentiation by controlling localization of Bam protein to the fusome.},

In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as DNA repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the DNA and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics.},

Even though the coding sequences and untranslated regions of these nested/including gene pairs do not overlap, their intimate structures and the possibility of shared regulatory sequences raise questions about the evolutionary forces governing the origination and subsequent functional and evolutionary impacts of these structures. In this study, we show that nested genes experience weaker evolutionary constraint, have faster rates of protein evolution, and are expressed in fewer tissues than other genes, while including genes show the opposite patterns. Surprisingly, despite completely overlapping with each other, nested and including genes are less likely to display correlated gene expression and biological function than the nearby yet nonoverlapping genes. Interestingly, significantly fewer nested genes are transcribed from the same strand as the including gene. We found that same-strand nested genes are more likely to be single-exon genes. In addition, same-strand including genes are less likely to have known lethal or sterile phenotypes than opposite-strand including genes only when the corresponding nested genes have introns. These results support our hypothesis that selection against potential erroneous mRNA splicing when nested and including genes are on the same strand plays an important role in the evolution of nested gene structures.},

One of these proteins is the Drosophila histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase Little imaginal discs (Lid), which has been genetically classified as a Trithorax group protein. However, contrary to the supposed function of Lid in gene activation, the biochemical activity of this protein entails the removal of a histone mark that is correlated with active transcription. To understand the molecular mechanism behind the function of Lid, we have purified a Lid-containing protein complex from Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts. In addition to Lid, the complex contains Rpd3, CG3815/Drosophila Pf1, CG13367, and Mrg15. Rpd3 is a histone deacetylase, and along with Polycomb group proteins, which antagonize the function of Trithorax group proteins, it negatively regulates transcription. By reconstituting the Lid complex, we demonstrated that the demethylase activity of Lid is not affected by its association with other proteins. However, the deacetylase activity of Rpd3 is greatly diminished upon incorporation into the Lid complex. Thus, our finding that Lid antagonizes Rpd3 function provides an explanation for the genetic classification of Lid as a positive transcription regulator.}

In wild-type germ lines, LIP-1 protein is present in the proximal third of the mitotic region, consistent with its effect on germline proliferation. We provide evidence that lip-1 expression in the germline mitotic region is controlled by a combination of GLP-1/Notch signaling and FBF repression. Unexpectedly, FBF controls the accumulation of lip-1 mRNA, and therefore is likely to control its stability or 3{${'}$}-end formation. In a sensitized mutant background, LIP-1 can function as a pivotal regulator of the decision between proliferation and differentiation.

These observations have raised questions about whether the functions of the two complexes in vivo are unique or overlapping. Here we use genome-wide expression analysis to investigate how expression of the yeast genome depends on both shared and unique subunits of these two complexes. We find that expression of most genes requires one or more of the common TAF(II) subunits, indicating that the functions of TFIID and SAGA are widely required for gene expression. Among the subunits shared by TFIID and SAGA are three histone- like TAF(II)s, which have been proposed to form a sub-complex and mediate a common function in global transcription. Unexpectedly, we find that the histone-like TAF(II)s have distinct roles in expression of the yeast genome. Most importantly, we show that the histone acetylase components of TFIID and SAGA (TAF(II)145 and Gcn5) are functionally redundant, indicating that expression of a large fraction of yeast genes can be regulated through the action of either complex.}

These are essential decisions that every cell is constantly challenged to make in multi-cellular organisms to ensure proper development, adult maintenance, and adaptability. SRY-related high-mobility-group box (Sox) transcription factors have emerged in the animal kingdom to help cells effect such decisions. They are encoded by 20 genes in humans and mice. They share a highly conserved high-mobility-group box domain that was originally identified in SRY, the sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome, and that has derived from a canonical high-mobility-group domain characteristic of chromatin-associated proteins. The high-mobility-group box domain binds DNA in the minor groove and increases its DNA binding affinity and specificity by interacting with many types of transcription factors. It also bends DNA and may thereby confer on Sox proteins a unique and critical role in the assembly of transcriptional enhanceosomes. Sox proteins fall into eight groups. Most feature a transactivation or transrepression domain and thereby also act as typical transcription factors. Each gene has distinct expression pattern and molecular properties, often redundant with those in the same group and overlapping with those in other groups. As a whole the Sox family controls cell fate and differentiation in a multitude of processes, such as male differentiation, stemness, neurogenesis, and skeletogenesis. We review their specific molecular properties and in vivo roles, stress recent advances in the field, and suggest directions for future investigations. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a sensitive lineage-labeling system to determine whether stem cells are needed in female adult mice to compensate for follicular losses and to directly identify active germ-line stem cells. Primordial follicles generated during fetal life are highly stable, with a half-life during adulthood of 10 mo, and thus are sufficient to sustain adult oogenesis without a source of renewal. Moreover, in normal mice or following germ-cell depletion with Busulfan, only stable, single oocytes are lineage-labeled, rather than cell clusters indicative of new oocyte formation. Even one germ-line stem cell division per 2 wk would have been detected by our method, based on the kinetics of fetal follicle formation. Thus, adult female mice neither require nor contain active germ-line stem cells or produce new oocytes in vivo.}

We performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis on flow-sorted male and female germ cells during embryogenesis at three time points surrounding sexual differentiation and female meiotic initiation, and then extended our analysis to meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells. We identified a set of genes that is highly enriched for regulators of differentiation and retains a poised state (high H3K4me3, high H3K27me3, and lack of expression) across sexes and across de\`eelopmental stages, including in haploid postmeiotic cells. The existence of such a state in embryonic stem cells has been well described. We now demonstrate that a subset of genes ismaintained in a poised state in the germ line from the initiation of sexual differentiation during fetal de\`eelopment and into postmeiotic stages. We propose that the epigenetically poised condition of these de\`eelopmental genes is a fundamental property of the mammalian germ-line nucleus, allowing differentiated gametes to unleash a totipotent program following fertilization.},

  abstract = {piRNAs guide the repression of diverse transposable elements in metazoan germ cells. Le Thomas et al. show that piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila germ cells depends on the inheritance of homologous piRNAs from the previous generation. Transgenerationally inherited piRNAs trigger piRNA biogenesis in the progeny by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs guide post-transcriptional processing of precursors into mature piRNAs. Second, inherited piRNAs direct the modification of the chromatin state of cluster sequences. This study provides key insights into the transgenerational mechanism that specifies piRNA biogenesis in the germline., Small noncoding RNAs that associate with Piwi proteins, called piRNAs, serve as guides for repression of diverse transposable elements in germ cells of metazoa. In Drosophila, the genomic regions that give rise to piRNAs, the so-called piRNA clusters, are transcribed to generate long precursor molecules that are processed into mature piRNAs. How genomic regions that give rise to piRNA precursor transcripts are differentiated from the rest of the genome and how these transcripts are specifically channeled into the piRNA biogenesis pathway are not known. We found that transgenerationally inherited piRNAs provide the critical trigger for piRNA production from homologous genomic regions in the next generation by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs enhance processing of homologous transcripts into mature piRNAs by initiating the ping-pong cycle in the cytoplasm. Second, inherited piRNAs induce installment of the histone 3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark on genomic piRNA cluster sequences. The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog Rhino binds to the H3K9me3 mark through its chromodomain and is enriched over piRNA clusters. Rhino recruits the piRNA biogenesis factor Cutoff to piRNA clusters and is required for efficient transcription of piRNA precursors. We propose that transgenerationally inherited piRNAs act as an epigenetic memory for identification of substrates for piRNA biogenesis on two levels: by inducing a permissive chromatin environment for piRNA precursor synthesis and by enhancing processing of these precursors.},

Instead, the protein kinase CK2 and the coactivator PC4 establish DPE-specific transcription in an in vitro transcription system containing TFIID, Mediator, and the GTFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses using the DPE-dependent IRF-1 and TAF7 promoters demonstrated that CK2, and PC4 are present on these promoters in vivo. In contrast, neither PC4 nor CK2 were detected on the TAF1-dependent cyclin D promoter, which contains a DCE type of downstream element. Our findings also demonstrate that CK2 activity alters TFIID-dependent recognition of DCE sequences. These data establish that CK2 acts as a switch, converting the transcriptional machinery from functioning on one type of downstream element to another. Copyright \textcopyright 2005 by Elsevier Inc.}

Crystal structural studies revealed that AF9 YEATS adopts an eight-stranded immunoglobin fold and utilizes a serine-lined aromatic "sandwiching" cage for acetyllysine readout, representing a novel recognition mechanism that is distinct from that of known acetyllysine readers. ChIP-seq experiments revealed a strong colocalization of AF9 and H3K9 acetylation genome-wide, which is important for the chromatin recruitment of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. Together, our studies identified the evolutionarily conserved YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module and established a direct link between histone acetylation and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcription control.}

The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is required for this process and binds to hundreds of sites on the male X chromosome. The MSL1 protein is essential for X chromosome binding and serves as a central scaffold for MSL complex assembly. We find that the amino-terminal region of MSL1 binds to hundreds of sites on the X chromosome in normal males but only to approximately 30 high-affinity sites in the absence of endogenous MSL1. Binding to the high-affinity sites requires a basic motif at the amino terminus that is conserved among Drosophila species. X chromosome binding also requires a conserved leucine zipper-like motif that binds to MSL2. A glycine-rich motif between the basic and leucine-zipper-like motifs mediates MSL1 self-association in vitro and binding of the amino-terminal region of MSL1 to the MSL complex assembled on the male X chromosome. We propose that the basic region may mediate DNA binding and that the glycine-rich region may promote the association of MSL complexes to closely adjacent sites on the X chromosome.

Recent evidence suggests that nucleoporins, well known components that control nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking, have wide-ranging functions in developmental gene regulation that potentially extend beyond their role in nuclear transport. Whether the unexpected role of nuclear pore proteins in transcription regulation, which initially has been described in fungi and flies, also applies to human cells is unknown. Here we show at a genome-wide level that the nuclear pore protein NUP98 associates with developmentally regulated genes active during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Overexpression of a dominant negative fragment of NUP98 levels decreases expression levels of NUP98-bound genes. In addition, we identify two modes of developmental gene regulation by NUP98 that are differentiated by the spatial localization of NUP98 target genes. Genes in the initial stage of developmental induction can associate with NUP98 that is embedded in the nuclear pores at the nuclear periphery. Alternatively, genes that are highly induced can interact with NUP98 in the nuclear interior, away from the nuclear pores. This work demonstrates for the first time that NUP98 dynamically associates with the human genome during differentiation, revealing a role of a nuclear pore protein in regulating developmental gene expression programs.},

Repression of Nos in Bam-expressing cells depends on sequences in the nos 3{${'}$}-UTR, suggesting that Nos is regulated by translational repression. Ectopic Bam causes differentiation of GSCs, and this activity depends on the endogenous nos 3{${'}$}-UTR sequence. Previous evidence showed that Bgcn is an obligate factor for the ability of Bam to drive differentiation, and we now report that Bam forms a complex with Bgcn, a protein related to the RNA-interacting DExH-box polypeptides. Together, these observations suggest that Bam-Bgcn act together to antagonize Nos expression; thus, derepressing cystoblast-promoting factors.

Among these modifications, trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone H3 (H3K36me3) and acetylation of lysine 16 in histone H4 (H4K16ac) have important roles in transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response signaling. However, whether these two epigenetic histone marks are mechanistically linked remains unclear. Here we discovered a new pathway through which H3K36me3 stimulates H4K16ac upon DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction in human cells. In particular, we examined, using Western blot analysis, the levels of H3K36me3 and H4K16ac in cells after exposure to various DSB-inducing agents, including neocarzinostatin, {$\gamma$} rays, and etoposide, and found that H3K36me3 and H4K16ac were both elevated in cells upon these treatments. We also observed that DSB-induced H4K16 acetylation was abolished in cells upon depletion of the histone methyltransferase gene SET-domain containing 2 (SETD2) and the ensuing loss of H3K36me3. Furthermore, the H3K36me3-mediated increase in H4K16ac necessitated lens epithelium\textendash{} derived growth factor p75 splicing variant (LEDGF), which is a reader protein of H3K36me3, and the KAT5 (TIP60) histone acetyltransferase. Mechanistically, the chromatin-bound LEDGF, through its interaction with KAT5, promoted chromatin localization of KAT5, thereby stimulating H4K16 acetylation. In this study, we unveiled cross-talk between two important histone epigenetic marks and defined the function of this cross-talk in DNA DSB repair.}

  abstract = {Drosophila Little imaginal discs (Lid) is a recently described member of the JmjC domain class of histone demethylases that specifically targets trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). To understand its biological function, we have utilized a series of Lid deletions and point mutations to assess the role that each domain plays in histone demethylation, in animal viability, and in cell growth mediated by the transcription factor dMyc. Strikingly, we find that lid mutants are rescued to adulthood by either wildtype or enzymatically inactive Lid expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter, demonstrating that Lid's demethylase activity is not essential for development. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of UASLid transgenes lacking its JmjN, C-terminal PHD domain, and C5HC2 zinc finger were unable to rescue lid homozygous mutants, indicating that these domains carry out Lid's essential developmental functions. Although Lid-dependent demethylase activity is not essential, dynamic removal of H3K4me3 may still be an important component of development, as we have observed a genetic interaction between lid and another H3K4me3 demethylase, dKDM2. We also show that Lid's essential C-terminal PHD finger binds specifically to di- and trimethylated H3K4 and that this activity is required for Lid to function in dMyc-induced cell growth. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of Lid function in the regulated removal and recognition of H3K4me3 during development. \textcopyright{} 2010 Li et al.}

  abstract = {The forkhead family protein FOXP3 acts as a repressor of transcription and is both an essential and sufficient regulator of the development and function of regulatory T cells. The molecular mechanism by which FOXP3-mediated transcriptional repression occurs remains unclear. Here, we report that transcriptional repression by FOXP3 involves a histone acetyltransferase- deacetylase complex that includes histone acetyltransferase TIP60 (Tat-interactive protein, 60 kDa) and class II histone deacetylases HDAC7 and HDAC9. The N-terminal 106-190 aa of FOXP3 are required for TIP60-FOXP3, HDAC7-FOXP3 association, as well as for the transcriptional repression of FOXP3 via its forkhead domain. FOXP3 can be acetylated in primary human regulatory T cells, and TIP60 promotes FOXP3 acetylation in vivo. Overexpression of TIP60 but not its histone acetyltransferase-deficient mutant promotes, whereas knockdown of endogenous TIP60 relieved, FOXP3-mediated transcriptional repression. A minimum FOXP3 ensemble containing native TIP60 and HDAC7 is necessary for IL-2 production regulation in T cells. Moreover, FOXP3 association with HDAC9 is antagonized by T cell stimulation and can be restored by the protein deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A, indicating a complex dynamic aspect of T suppressor cell regulation. These findings identify a previously uncharacterized complex-based mechanism by which FOXP3 actively mediates transcriptional repression. \textcopyright{} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Early during Drosophila oogenesis the 16 interconnected cells of each germ-line cyst choose between two alternative fates. The single future oocyte enters meiosis, arrests, and becomes transcriptionally quiescent. The remaining 15 cells initiate a series of polyploid cell cycles to prepare for their role as nurse cells. Like many other polyploid and polytene cells, during nurse cell growth the major satellite DNAs become highly under-represented by a mechanism that has remained obscure. We implicate the cell-cycle regulator cyclin E in DNA under-representation by identifying a hypomorphic, female sterile cycE mutation, cycE01672, that increases the amount of satellite DNA propagated in nurse cells. In mutant but not wild-type endomitotic nurse cells, "late S" patterns of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation are observed similar to those in mitotic cells. CycE protein still cycles in cycE01672 germ-line cysts but at reduced levels, and it is found throughout a longer fraction of the cell cycle. Our experiments support the view that oscillating levels of CycE control the polyploid S phase. Moreover, they indicate that a checkpoint linking the presence of unreplicated DNA to the CycE oscillator is lacking, leading to incomplete replication of late-replicating sequences such as satellite DNAs. Unexpectedly, two to three of the 16 cells in cycE01672 cysts frequently differentiate as oocytes, implicating cell-cycle programming in oocyte determination.},

  abstract = {Mono-, di- and trimethylated states of particular histone lysine residues are selectively found in different regions of chromatin, thereby implying specialized biological functions for these marks ranging from heterochromatin formation to X-chromosome inactivation and transcriptional regulation. A major challenge in chromatin biology has centred on efforts to define the connection between specific methylation states and distinct biological read-outs impacting on function. For example, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with transcription start sites of active genes, but the molecular 'effectors' involved in specific recognition of H3K4me3 tails remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the molecular basis for specific recognition of H3(1-15)K4me3 (residues 1-15 of histone H3 trimethylated at K4) by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of human BPTF (bromodomain and PHD domain transcription factor), the largest subunit of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, NURF (nucleosome remodelling factor). We report on crystallographic and NMR structures of the bromodomain-proximal PHD finger of BPTF in free and H3(1-15)K4me3-bound states. H3(1-15)K4me3 interacts through anti-parallel {$B$}-sheet formation on the surface of the PHD finger, with the long side chains of arginine 2 (R2) and K4me3 fitting snugly in adjacent pre-formed surface pockets, and bracketing an invariant tryptophan. The observed stapling role by non-adjacent R2 and K4me3 provides a molecular explanation for H3K4me3 site specificity. Binding studies establish that the BPTF PHD finger exhibits a modest preference for K4me3- over K4me2-containing H3 peptides, and discriminates against monomethylated and unmodified counterparts. Furthermore, we identified key specificity-determining residues from binding studies of H3(1-15)K4me3 with PHD finger point mutants. Our findings call attention to the PHD finger as a previously uncharacterized chromatin-binding module found in a large number of chromatin-associated proteins. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

We identified the adducin-like hts product and {$\alpha$}-spectrin as molecular components of fusomes, discovered a related structure in germline stem cells and documented regular associations between fusomes and cystocyte centrosomes. hts mutations completely eliminated fusomes, causing abnormal cysts containing a reduced number of cells to form.

To date, a detailed description of P-bodies in Drosophila oogenesis is lacking. To this end, we first demonstrate that Drosophila decapping protein 2 (dDcp2) contains intrinsic decapping activity and its enzymatic activity was not detectably enhanced by Drosophila decapping protein 1 (dDcp1). dDcp1-containing bodies in the nurse cell cytoplasm can associate with the 5{${'}$} to 3{${'}$} exoribonuclease, Pacman in addition to dDcp2 and Me31B. The size and number of dDcp1 bodies are dynamic and dramatically increased in dDcp2 and pacman mutant backgrounds supporting the conclusion that dDcp1 bodies in nurse cell cytoplasm are Drosophila P-bodies. In stage 2-6 oocytes, dDcp1 bodies appear to be distinct from previously characterized P-bodies since they are insensitive to cycloheximide and RNase A treatments. Curiously, dDcp2 and Pacman do not colocalize with dDcp1 at the posterior end of the oocyte in stage 9-10 oocytes. This suggests that dDcp1 bodies are in a developmentally distinct state separate from the 5{${'}$} end mRNA degradation enzymes at later stages in the oocyte. Interestingly, re-formation of maternally expressed dDcp1 with dDcp2 and Pacman was observed in early embryogenesis. With respect to developmental switching, the maternal dDcp1 is proposed to serve as a marker for the re-formation of P-bodies in early embryos. This also suggests that a regulated conversion occurs between maternal RNA granules and P-bodies from oogenesis to embryogenesis. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Subsequently, 15 cystocytes begin to transport specific RNAs and other components into the remaining cell, the future oocyte. We used fusome-specific antibodies to characterize the early stages of cyst formation. During the first cystoblast division, a spherical mass of fusome material (the "spectrosome") was associated with only one pole of the mitotic spindle, revealing that this division is asymmetric. During the subsequent three divisions, the growing fusome always associated with the pole of each mitotic spindle that remained in the mother cell, and only extended through the newly formed ring canals after each division was completed. These observations suggest that fusomes help establish a system of directional transport between cystocytes that underlies oocyte determination.},

We demonstrate that, in mouse embryos, extrinsic and intrinsic factors together regulate meiotic initiation. The mouse RNA-binding protein DAZL, which is expressed by postmigratory germ cells, is a key intrinsic factor, enabling those cells to initiate meiosis in response to RA. Within a brief developmental window, Dazl-expressing germ cells in both XX and XY embryos actively acquire the ability to interpret RA as a meiosis-inducing signal.}

When individual germaria were dissected free of developing eggs and sheath tissue and transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a host fly, they regenerated ovariole-like structures and continuously supported the entire process of oogenesis, indicating that the stem cells remained functional. This system allowed us to measure the duration of several stages in oogenesis and to analyze the role of specific germarial cells in providing stem cell function. Laser ablation of presumptive germline stem cells near the apical tip prior to transplantation blocked the production of new germline cysts, but allowed previously initiated cysts to complete development. This confirmed the location of germline stem cells and showed that subsequent development of preexisting cysts did not require continued cyst production. Ablation of a distinct group of somatic cells lying close to the germline stem cells ("the terminal filament") increased the rate of oogenesis by approximately 40\%, suggesting that the terminal filament may negatively regulate stem cell division. \textcopyright{} 1993 Academic Press, Inc.}

Its mRNA is approximately 5.5 kilobases and is detected in several different cell types that were examined. Cell extraction experiments show that MAN1 is an integral membrane protein. When expressed in transfected cells, MAN1 is exclusively targeted to the nuclear envelope, consistent with an inner nuclear membrane localization. Protein sequence analysis reveals that MAN1 shares a conserved globular domain of approximately 40 amino acids, which we term the LEM module, with inner nuclear membrane proteins lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin. The LEM module is also present in two proteins of Caenorhabdltis elegans.

Significantly, this occurs independently of KDM5's well-described JmjC domain-encoded histone demethylase activity. Instead, it requires the PHD motif of KDM5 that binds to histone H3 that is di- or trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3). Genome-wide, KDM5 binding overlaps with the active chromatin mark H3K4me3, and a fly strain specifically lacking H3K4me2/3 binding shows defective KDM5 promoter recruitment and gene activation. KDM5 therefore plays a central role in regulating mitochondrial function by utilizing its ability to recognize specific chromatin contexts.

The way in which H3K4me3 is regulated at TSS and the actual molecular basis of its contribution to transcription remain largely unanswered. To address these questions, we have analyzed the contribution of dKDM5/LID, the main H3K4me3 demethylase in Drosophila, to the regulation of the pattern of H3K4me3. ChIP-seq results show that, at developmental genes, dKDM5/LID localizes at TSS and regulates H3K4me3. dKDM5/LID target genes are highly transcribed and enriched in active RNApol II and H3K36me3, suggesting a positive contribution to transcription. Expression-profiling show that, though weakly, dKDM5/LID target genes are significantly downregulated upon dKDM5/LID depletion. Furthermore, dKDM5/LID depletion results in decreased RNApol II occupancy, particularly by the promoter-proximal Pol lloser5 form. Our results also show that ASH2, an evolutionarily conserved factor that locates at TSS and is required for H3K4me3, binds and positively regulates dKDM5/LID target genes. However, dKDM5/LID and ASH2 do not bind simultaneously and recognize different chromatin states, enriched in H3K4me3 and not, respectively. These results indicate that, at developmental genes, dKDM5/LID and ASH2 coordinately regulate H3K4me3 at TSS and that this dynamic regulation contributes to transcription. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).}

  abstract = {Retinoblastoma protein (pRB) mediates cell-cycle withdrawal and differentiation by interacting with a variety of proteins. RB-Binding Protein 2 (RBP2) has been shown to be a key effector. We sought to determine transcriptional regulation by RBP2 genome-wide by using location analysis and gene expression profiling experiments. We describe that RBP2 shows high correlation with the presence of H3K4me3 and its target genes are separated into two functionally distinct classes: differentiation-independent and differentiation-dependent genes. The former class is enriched by genes that encode mitochondrial proteins, while the latter is represented by cell-cycle genes. We demonstrate the role of RBP2 in mitochondrial biogenesis, which involves regulation of H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes. Analysis of expression changes upon RBP2 depletion depicted genes with a signature of differentiation control, analogous to the changes seen upon reintroduction of pRB. We conclude that, during differentiation, RBP2 exerts inhibitory effects on multiple genes through direct interaction with their promoters. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and progenitor spermatogonia encompass the undifferentiated spermatogonial pool in mammalian testes. In rodents, this population is comprised of Asingle, Apaired and chains of 4-16 Aaligned spermatogonia. Although traditional models propose that the entire Asingle pool represents SSCs, and formation of an Apaired syncytium symbolizes irreversible entry to a progenitor state destined for differentiation; recent models have emerged that suggest that the Asingle pool is heterogeneous, and Apaired/Aaligned can fragment to produce new SSCs. In this review, we explore evidence from the literature for these differing models representing SSC dynamics, including the traditional 'Asingle' and more recently formed 'fragmentation' models. Further, based on findings using a fluorescent reporter transgene (eGfp) that reflects expression of the SSC-specific transcription factor 'inhibitor of DNA binding 4' (Id4), we propose a revised version of the traditional model in which SSCs are a subset of the Asingle population; the ID4-eGFP bright cells (SSCultimate). From the SSCultimate pool, other Asingle and Apaired cohorts arise that are ID4-eGFP dim. Although the SSCultimate possess a transcriptome profile that reflects a self-renewing state, the transcriptome of the ID4-eGFP dim population resembles that of cells in transition (SSCtransitory) to a progenitor state. Accordingly, at the next mitotic division, these SSCtransitory are likely to join the progenitor pool and have lost stem cell capacity. This model supports the concept of a linear relationship between spermatogonial chain length and propensity for differentiation, while leaving open the possibility that the SSCtransitory (some Asingle and potentially some Apaired spermatogonia), may contribute to the self-renewing pool rather than transition to a progenitor state in response to perturbations of steady-state conditions.}

Here, we discovered that, in mouse testes, both spermatogonial populations possess intrinsic RA-response machinery and exhibit hallmarks of the differentiating transition following direct exposure to RA, including loss of SSC regenerative capacity. We determined that SSCs are only resistant to RA-driven differentiation when situated in the normal topological organization of the testis. Furthermore, we show that the soma is instrumental in ``priming'' TA progenitors for RA-induced differentiation through elevated RA receptor expression. Collectively, these findings indicate that SSCs and TA progenitor spermatogonia inhabit disparate niche microenvironments within seminiferous tubules that are critical for mediating extrinsic cues that drive fate decisions. Lord et al. have demonstrated that, contrary to previous assumptions, spermatogonial stem cells do express a functional complement of retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors (RARs/RXRs) and rely on protection from an undisturbed niche microenvironment to prevent loss of the spermatogenic reservoir to RA-induced differentiation.},

The understanding of this phenomenon stems from the realization that all of the cells of a developing embryo are identical with respect to their genetic material and that differentiation is achieved by the differential expression of genes in regions of the embryo during the course of development. These cell or tissue-specific expression forms of the genome can be referred to as epigenomes, each of which is characteristic of a particular modality of cellular differentiation. Epigenomes arise through the influence of a wide range of environmental factors that include gradients of maternal morphogens and intercellular signals as well as extra-embryonic environmental factors. These stimuli result in covalent modifications of the DNA that do not alter in any way the nucleotide-based genetic code, and of many of the DNA-associated proteins; they also result in a change in the architecture of the association. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Cyp26b1-/- germ cells prematurely enter meiosis at embryonic d 13.5 and appear to arrest at pachytene stage. Furthermore, after embryonic d 13.5, a rapid increase in apoptosis is observed in male germ cells derived from Cyp26b1-/- embryos; germ cells are essentially absent in mutant male neonates. In contrast, testicular somatic cells appear to develop normally in the absence of Cyp26b1. Moreover, ovarian germ and somatic cells appear unaffected by the lack of CYP26B1. We also show that the synthetic retinoid Am580, which is resistant to CYP26 metabolism, induces meiosis of male germ cells in cultured gonads, suggesting that abnormal development of germ cells in the Cyp26b1-/- testes results from excess RA rather than the absence of CYP26B1-generated metabolites of RA. These results provide evidence that CYP26B1 maintains low levels of RA in the developing testes that blocks entry into meiosis and acts as a survival factor to prevent apoptosis of male germ cells.

Conceivably, the RNA helicase MLE, itself an MSL subunit, is actively involved in incorporating roX into functional DCC. We determined the secondary structure of roX2 and mapped specific interaction sites for MLE invitro. Upon addition of ATP, MLE disrupted a functionally important stem loop in roX2. This RNA remodeling enhanced specific ATP-dependent association of MSL2, the core subunit of the MSL-DCC, providing a link between roX and MSL subunits. Probing the conformation of roX invivo revealed a remodeled stem loop in chromatin-bound roX2. The active remodeling of a stable secondary structure by MLE may constitute a rate-limiting step for MSL-DCC assembly. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.}

In the soma Sxl has an embryonic determinative role and is required throughout the life of female flies; in germ cells its expression begins only in the larval ovary. Both the mechanism for activating Sxl and the genes controlled by Sxl are different in the germline. A number of genes have been identified that are essential either for survival (e.g. ovo, otu) or differentiation (snf, Sxl, fl(2)d, bgcn) of female germ cells. ovo is required during embryogenesis for survival of pole cells. Genetic interactions with dominant alleles of ovo and/or Sxl indicate that otu, Sxl, snf and fl(2)d act in the same pathway as does ovo. bgcn differs in that neither ovo nor SxlD mutations affect the bgcn phenotype even though XX bgcn germ cells enter the male pathway. bgcn causes sterility in both sexes. Although the germline defect is cell autonomous in mosaic gonads, bgcn is also required in the somatic tissue for maintaining oogenesis of wild-type germ cells. Several dominant suppressors of bgcn have been identified and some have properties similar to Suppressors of variegation, suggesting that chromatin structure is critical for proper germ cell sex determination.}

In the germline, silencing programs encoded within piRNA clusters are optimized via a slicer-dependent amplification loop to suppress a broad spectrum of elements.

  abstract = {MAN1 is a vertebrate nuclear inner membrane protein that inhibits Smad signaling downstream of transforming growth factor {$\beta$}. MAN1 has an exposed LEM domain-containing N-terminal region ("MAN1-N"), two transmembrane domains, and an exposed C-terminal domain ("MAN1-C"). Many regions of human MAN1 are homologous to emerin, a LEM domain nuclear protein, loss of which causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). To test the hypothesis that MAN1 function might overlap with emerin, we tested different polypeptide fragments of MAN1 for binding to selected partners of emerin. Our findings support this hypothesis. Blot overlay assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that MAN1-C binds the transcription regulators GCL, Btf, and barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). BAF binding to this region, which has no LEM domain, was notable. Sequence alignments identified a potential BAF-binding motif, characterized by the conserved residues Ser-Arg-Val, in MAN1-C and two other BAF-binding proteins. The other region, MAN1-N, bound directly to BAF, lamin A, and lamin B1, supporting functional overlap with emerin. Unexpectedly, three independent assays showed that MAN1-N also bound directly to emerin. Proposed MAN1-emerin complexes are discussed in the context of EDMD disease mechanisms and potential in vivo functions. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

P-TEFb is essential for the production of DRB- sensitive long transcripts in vitro, while P-TEFa and factor 2 are stimulatory. P-TEFb activity is associated with a protein comprising two polypeptide subunits with apparent molecular masses of 124 and 43 kDa.

In vivo footprinting and immunocytochemical analyses revealed that all of the sequence-specific transcription factors were displaced from promoter sequences as well as from bulk chromatin during mitosis. The correlation of transcription factor displacement with chromatin condensation suggests an involvement of chromatin structure in mitotic repression. However, retention of DNase I hypersensitivity suggests that the hsp70 promoter was not organized in a canonical nucleosome structure in mitotic chromatin. Displacement of transcription factors from mitotic chromosomes could present another window in the cell cycle for resetting transcriptional programs. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

Loss of these helicases, which we named Aramis, Athos and Porthos, lead to aberrant stabilization of p53, cell cycle arrest and stalled GSC differentiation. Unexpectedly, Aramis is required for efficient translation of a cohort of mRNAs containing a 5'-Terminal-Oligo-Pyrimidine (TOP)-motif, including mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins and a conserved p53 inhibitor, Novel Nucleolar protein 1 (Non1). The TOP-motif co-regulates the translation of growth-related mRNAs in mammals. As in mammals, the La-related protein co-regulates the translation of TOP-motif containing RNAs during \emph{Drosophila} oogenesis. Thus, a previously unappreciated TOP-motif in \emph{Drosophila} responds to reduced ribosome biogenesis to co-regulate the translation of ribosomal proteins and a p53 repressor, thus coupling ribosome biogenesis to GSC differentiation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been shown to cause an array of cellular and developmental defects in a variety of organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, disruption of RP genes can result in the 'Minute' syndrome of dominant, haploinsufficient phenotypes, which include prolonged development, short and thin bristles, and poor fertility and viability. While more than 50 Minute loci have been defined genetically, only 15 have so far been characterized molecularly and shown to correspond to RP genes. Results: We combined bioinformatic and genetic approaches to conduct a systematic analysis of the relationship between RP genes and Minute loci. First, we identified 88 genes encoding 79 different cytoplasmic RPs (CRPs) and 75 genes encoding distinct mitochondrial RPs (MRPs). Interestingly, nine CRP genes are present as duplicates and, while all appear to be functional, one member of each gene pair has relatively limited expression. Next, we defined 65 discrete Minute loci by genetic criteria. Of these, 64 correspond to, or very likely correspond to, CRP genes; the single non-CRP-encoding Minute gene encodes a translation initiation factor subunit. Significantly, MRP genes and more than 20 CRP genes do not correspond to Minute loci. Conclusion: This work answers a longstanding question about the molecular nature of Minute loci and suggests that Minute phenotypes arise from suboptimal protein synthesis resulting from reduced levels of cytoribosomes. Furthermore, by identifying the majority of haplolethal and haplosterile loci at the molecular level, our data will directly benefit efforts to attain complete deletion coverage of the D. melanogaster genome. \textcopyright{} 2007 Marygold et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

These methods are based on the observation that cells still connected by some cytoplasm share some degree of synchronization of their cell cycle. This synchrony can be detected on fixed tissue (Section 1.1), including using EdU incorporation to label S-phase (Section 1.2). Mitotic synchrony can also be observed using short-term live imaging (Section 1.3).

Recent technical advances have allowed a better understanding of the cellular and molecular events leading to abscission in isolated yeast or mammalian cells. However, how abscission is regulated in different cell types or in a developing organism remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the function of the ESCRT-III protein Shrub during cytokinesis in germ cells undergoing a series of complete and incomplete divisions. We found that Shrub is required for complete abscission, and that levels of Shrub are critical for proper timing of abscission. Loss or gain of Shrub delays abscission in germline stem cells (GSCs), and leads to the formation of stem-cysts, where daughter cells share the same cytoplasm as the mother stem cell and cannot differentiate. In addition, our results indicate a negative regulation of Shrub by the Aurora B kinase during GSC abscission. Finally, we found that Lethal giant discs (lgd), known to be required for Shrub function in the endosomal pathway, also regulates the duration of abscission in GSCs.}

Four discrete patterns of chromatin organization exist in germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes isolated from the ovaries of 21\textendash 25-day-old gonadotropin-primed mice. Analysis of ovarian cryosections stained with the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 indicates that sequential changes in GV chromatin occur duing folliculogenesis that result in the formation of a continuous perinucleolar chromatin sheath at the time of antrum formation. Specific alterations in the cytoplasmic microtubule complex of GV-stage oocytes were observed that correlate with chromatin patterns. The extensive cytoplasmic microtubule complex seen in oocytes of preantral follicles initially localizes to perinuclear areas of the ooplasm. This is followed by a progressive reduction in cytoplasmic microtubules and the appearance of prominent microtubule-organizing centers at the nuclear periphery. Coordinated nuclear and microtubular alterations also occur under in vitro conditions prior to progression of meiosis to prometaphase-1. The results are discussed with respect to the ongoing differentiation of the oocyte nucleus and the microtubule cytoskeleton during folliculogenesis in preparation for the resumption of meiosis.

Set2, which deposits H3K36me3 modifications, is required for differentiation of GSCs during Drosophila oogenesis. We discovered that the H3K36me3 reader Male-specific lethal 3 (MSL3) and the histone acetyltransferase complex Ada2a-containing (ATAC) cooperate with Set2 to regulate entry into meiosis in female Drosophila . MSL3 expression is restricted to the mitotic and early meiotic stages of the female germline, where it promotes transcription of genes encoding synaptonemal complex components and a germline enriched ribosomal protein S19 paralog, RpS19b . RpS19b upregulation is required for translation of Rbfox1, a known meiotic cell cycle entry factor. Thus, MSL3 is a master regulator of meiosis, coordinating the expression of factors required for recombination and GSC differentiation. We find that MSL3 is expressed during mouse spermatogenesis, suggesting a conserved function during meiosis.}

However, the regulation of GSC differentiation and meiotic entry are incompletely understood. Set2, which deposits H3K36me3 modifications, is required for differentiation of GSCs during \emph{Drosophila} oogenesis. We discovered that the H3K36me3 reader Male-specific lethal 3 (MSL3) and the histone acetyltransferase complex Ada2a-containing (ATAC) cooperate with Set2 to regulate entry into meiosis in female \emph{Drosophila}. MSL3 expression is restricted to the mitotic and early meiotic stages of the female germline, where it promotes transcription of genes encoding synaptonemal complex components and a germline enriched \emph{ribosomal protein S19} paralog, \emph{RpS19b}. \emph{RpS19b} upregulation is required for translation of Rbfox1, a known meiotic cell cycle entry factor. Thus, MSL3 is a master regulator of meiosis, coordinating the expression of factors required for recombination and GSC differentiation. We find that MSL3 is expressed during mouse spermatogenesis, suggesting a conserved function during meiosis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Germline stem cells (GSCs) self-renew and differentiate to sustain a continuous production of gametes. In the female Drosophila germ line, two differentiation factors, bag of marbles ( bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm ( bgcn), work in concert in the stem cell daughter to promote the generation of eggs. In GSCs, bam transcription is repressed by signaling from the niche and is activated in stem cell daughters. In contrast, bgcn is transcribed in both the GSCs and stem cell daughters, but little is known about how bgcn is transcriptionally modulated. Here we find that the conserved protein Nipped-A acts through the Tat interactive protein 60-kDa (Tip60) histone acetyl transferase complex in the germ line to promote GSC daughter differentiation. We find that Nipped-A is required for efficient exit from the gap phase 2 (G2) of cell cycle of the GSC daughter and for expression of a differentiation factor, bgcn. Loss of Nipped-A results in accumulation of GSC daughters . Forced expression of bgcn in Nipped-A germline-depleted ovaries rescues this differentiation defect. Together, our results indicate that Tip60 complex coordinates cell cycle progression and expression of bgcn to help drive GSC daughters toward a differentiation program.}

Here, we report that depletion of the NPC basket protein Tpr, but not Nup153, dramatically increases the total NPC number in various cell types. This negative regulation of Tpr occurs via a phosphorylation cascade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the central kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Tpr serves as a scaffold for ERK to phosphorylate the nucleoporin (Nup) Nup153, which is critical for early stages of NPC biogenesis. Our results reveal a critical role of the Nup Tpr in coordinating signal transduction pathways during cell proliferation and the dynamic organization of the nucleus.},

Studies reveal that H3K36me not only prevents inappropriate transcriptional initiation from arising within gene bodies, but that it has other conserved functions that include the repair of damaged DNA and regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Consistent with the importance of Set2/SETD2 in chromatin biology, mutations of SETD2, or mutations at or near H3K36 in H3.3, have recently been found to underlie cancer development. This review will summarize the latest insights into the functions of Set2/SETD2 in genome regulation and cancer development.},

  abstract = {In mammals, flies, and worms, sex is determined by distinctive regulatory mechanisms that cause males (XO or XY) and females (XX) to differ in their dose of X chromosomes. In each species, an essential X chromosome-wide process called dosage compensation ensures that somatic cells of either sex express equal levels of X-linked gene products. The strategies used to achieve dosage compensation are diverse, but in all cases, specialized complexes are targeted specifically to the X chromosome(s) of only one sex to regulate transcript levels. In C. elegans, this sex-specific targeting of the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is controlled by the same developmental signal that establishes sex, the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A signal). Molecular components of this chromosome counting process have been defined. Following a common step of regulation, sex determination and dosage compensation are controlled by distinct genetic pathways. C. elegans dosage compensation is implemented by a protein complex that binds both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to reduce transcript levels by one-half. The dosage compensation complex resembles the conserved 13S condensin complex required for both mitotic and meiotic chromosome resolution and condensation, implying the recruitment of ancient proteins to the new task of regulating gene expression. Within each C. elegans somatic cell, one of the DCC components also participates in the separate mitotic/meiotic condensin complex. Other DCC components play pivotal roles in regulating the number and distribution of crossovers during meiosis. The strategy by which C. elegans X chromosomes attract the condensin-like DCC is known. Small, well-dispersed X-recognition elements act as entry sites to recruit the dosage compensation complex and to nucleate spreading of the complex to X regions that lack recruitment sites. In this manner, a repressed chromatin state is spread in cis over short or long distances, thus establishing the global, epigenetic regulation of X chromosomes that is maintained throughout the lifetime of hermaphrodites.}

The RA biosynthetic enzyme RALDH2 catalyzes much, but not all, RA production in mouse embryos, as revealed here with Raldh2 null mutants carrying an RA-responsive transgene. Targeted disruption of Raldh2 arrests development at midgestation and eliminates all RA synthesis except that associated with Raldh3 expression in the surface ectoderm of the eye field. Conditional rescue of Raldh2-/- embryos by limited maternal RA administration allows development to proceed and results in the establishment of additional sites of RA synthesis linked to Raldh1 expression in the dorsal retina and to Raldh3 expression in the ventral retina, olfactory pit and urinary tract. Unexpectedly, conditionally rescued Raldh2-/- embryos also possess novel sites of RA synthesis in the neural tube and heart that do not correspond to expression of Raldh1-3. RA synthesis in the mutant neural tube was localized in the spinal cord, posterior hindbrain and portions of the midbrain and forebrain, whereas activity in the mutant heart was localized in the conotruncus and sinus venosa. In the posterior hindbrain, this novel RA-generating activity was expressed during establishment of rhombomeric boundaries. In the spinal cord, the novel activity was localized in the floorplate plus in the intermediate region where retinoid-dependent interneurons develop. These novel RA-generating activities in the neural tube and heart fill gaps in our knowledge of how RA is generated spatiotemporally and may, along with Raldh1 and Raldh3, contribute to rescue of Raldh2-/- embryos by producing RA locally.},

We report the purification and molecular identification of the subunits of a protein complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that includes the trithorax-related protein Set1. This protein complex, which we have named COMPASS (Complex Proteins Associated with Set1), consists of seven polypeptides ranging from 130 to 25 kDa. The same seven proteins were identified in COMPASS purified either by conventional biochemical chromatography or tandem-affinity tagging of the individual subunits of the complex. Null mutants missing any one of the six nonessential subunits of COMPASS grow more slowly than wild-type cells under normal conditions and demonstrate growth sensitivity to hydroxyurea. Furthermore, gene expression profiles of strains missing either of two nonessential subunits of COMPASS are altered in similar ways, suggesting these proteins have similar roles in gene expression in vivo. Molecular characterization of trithorax complexes will facilitate defining the role of this class of proteins in the regulation of gene expression and how their misregulation results in the development of human cancer.},

We find that Asf1 in budding yeast promotes an essential cellular response to replication stress caused by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea. That is, Asf1 stimulates derepression of DNA damage response (DDR) genes during the S phase. Derepression of DDR genes strongly correlates with Asf1 binding to their promoters. Having identified the C terminus and histone-binding domains of Asf1 as molecular determinants of its constitutive and inducible association with chromatin, we tested whether Asf1 binding to DDR genes is mechanistically important for their derepression. Our results provide little support for this hypothesis. Rather, the contribution of Asf1 to DDR gene derepression depends on its ability to stimulate H3K56 acetylation by lysine acetyltransferase Rtt109. The precise regulation of H3K56 acetylation in the promoters of DDR genes is unexpected: DDR gene promoters are occupied by H3K56-acetylated nucleosomes under repressing conditions, and the steady state level of H3K56 promoter acetylation does not change upon derepression. We propose that replication-coupled deposition of Lys56-acetylated H3 poises the DDR genes in newly synthesized daughter duplexes for derepression during the S phase. In this model, the presence of a histone mark that destabilizes nucleosomes is compatible with suppression of transcription because in the uninduced state, DDR gene promoters are constitutively occupied by a potent repressor-corepressor complex. \textcopyright{} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

Here, we reconstitute the female sex determination in mouse germ cells in vitro under a defined condition without the use of gonadal somatic cells. We show that retinoic acid (RA) and its key effector, STRA8, are not sufficient to induce the female germ-cell fate. In contrast, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and RA synergistically induce primordial germ cells (PGCs)/PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into fetal primary oocytes. The induction is characterized by entry into the meiotic prophase, occurs synchronously and recapitulates cytological and transcriptome progression in vivo faithfully. Importantly, the female germ-cell induction necessitates a proper cellular competence?most typically, DNA demethylation of relevant genes?which is observed in appropriately propagated PGCs/PGCLCs, but not in PGCs/PGCLCs immediately after induction. This provides an explanation for the differential function of BMP signaling between PGC specification and female germ-cell induction. Our findings represent a framework for a comprehensive delineation of the sex-determination pathway in mammalian germ cells, including humans.},

Depletion of ZZZ3 or disruption of the ZZ-H3 interaction dampens ATAC-dependent promoter histone H3K9 acetylation and target gene expression.

Drosophila germ cells in both sexes initially follow a similar pathway. After germline stem cells are established, their daughters form interconnected cysts surrounded by somatic escort (female) or cyst (male) cells and enter meiosis. Subsequently, female cysts acquire a new covering of somatic cells to form follicles. Knocking down expression of the heterodimeric ecdysteroid receptor (EcR/Usp) or the E75 early response gene in escort cells disrupts 16-cell cyst production, meiotic entry and follicle formation. Escort cells lose their squamous morphology and unsheath germ cells. By contrast, disrupting ecdysone signaling in males does not perturb cyst development or ensheathment. Thus, sex-specific steroid signaling is essential for female germ cell development at the time male and female pathways diverge. Our results suggest that steroid signaling plays an important sex-specific role in early germ cell development in Drosophila, a strategy that may be conserved in mammals. \textcopyright{} 2012 Morris, Spradling.}

To prevent the assembly of the MSL dosage compensation complex in female flies, Sxl acts as a repressor of male-specific lethal-2 (msl-2) mRNA translation. It uses two distinct and mutually reinforcing blocks to translation that operate on the 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} untranslated regions (UTRs) of msl-2 mRNA, respectively. While 5{${'}$} UTR-mediated translational control involves an upstream open reading frame, 3{${'}$} UTR-mediated regulation strictly requires the co-repressor protein Upstream of N-ras (Unr), which is recruited to the transcript by Sxl. We have identified the protein Sister-of-Sex-lethal (Ssx) as a novel repressor of translation with Sxl-like activity. Both proteins have a comparable RNA-binding specificity and can associate with uracil-rich RNA regulatory elements present in msl-2 mRNA. Moreover, both repress translation when bound to the 5{${'}$} UTR of msl-2. However, Ssx is inactive in 3{${'}$} UTR-mediated regulation, as it cannot engage the co-repressor protein Unr.

Here, we analyzed the cooperation of H3/H4 chaperone ASF1 and H2A/H2B chaperone NAP1 with two closely related silencing complexes: LAF and RLAF. NAP1 binds RPD3 and LID-associated factors (RLAF) comprising histone deacetylase RPD3, histone H3K4 demethylase LID/KDM5, SIN3A, PF1, EMSY, and MRG15. ASF1 binds LAF, a similar complex lacking RPD3. ASF1 and NAP1 link, respectively, LAF and RLAF to the DNA-binding Su(H)/Hairless complex, which targets the E(spl) NOTCH-regulated genes. ASF1 facilitates gene-selective removal of the H3K4me3 mark by LAF but has no effect on H3 deacetylation. NAP1 directs high nucleosome density near E(spl) control elements and mediates both H3 deacetylation and H3K4me3 demethylation by RLAF. We conclude that histone chaperones ASF1 and NAP1 differentially modulate local chromatin structure during gene-selective silencing. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The processes of DNA synthesis in meiotic and mitotic cells have different features that are not easily distinguishable through morphological means. In order to characterize the pre-meiotic S phase, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally into Wistar rats, which were sacrificed 30 min, 2 hr, and 24 hr after injection. We found three different labeling patterns. One of these patterns was characterized by a distribution of the label in the form of speckles, most of which were associated with the nuclear envelope (labeling type I). We suggest that this pattern is due to mitotic DNA synthesis of type B spermatogonia. Labeling type II consisted of labeled foci scattered throughout the nuclear volume, which can be correlated with preleptotenic cells in pre-meiotic DNA synthesis. After 24 hr of incorporation, a third type of labeling, characterized by large speckles, was found to be related to cells in the "bouquet" stage; that is, cells in transition between the leptotene and zygotene phases. Our results indicate that BrdU incorporation induces different labeling patterns in the mitotic and pre-meiotic S phases and thus makes it possible to identify somatic and germinal cells. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2013.},

Recent studies have implicated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes and chromatin acetylation in DNA repair; however, the precise underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the HAT cofactor Trrap and Tip60 HAT bind to the chromatin surrounding sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo. Trrap depletion impairs both DNA-damage-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation and accumulation of repair molecules at sites of DSBs, resulting in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair, albeit with the presence of a functional ATM-dependent DNA-damage signalling cascade. Importantly, the impaired loading of repair proteins and the defect in DNA repair in Trrap-deficient cells can be counteracted by chromatin relaxation, indicating that the DNA-repair defect that was observed in the absence of Trrap is due to impeded chromatin accessibility at sites of DNA breaks. Thus, these data reveal that cells may use the same basic mechanism involving HAT complexes to regulate distinct cellular processes, such as transcription and DNA repair. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

CPSF recognizes the AAUAAA signal in the pre-mRNA and interacts with other proteins to facilitate both RNA cleavage and poly(A) synthesis. Here we describe the isolation of cDNAs encoding the largest subunit of CPSF (160K) as well as characterization of the protein product. Antibodies raised against the recombinant protein inhibit polyadenylation in vitro, which can be restored by purified CPSF. Extending previous studies, which suggested that 160K contacts the pre-mRNA, we show that purified recombinant 160K can, by itself, bind preferentially to AAUAAA-containing RNAs. While the sequence of 160K reveals similarities to the RNP1 and RNP9 motifs found in many RNA- binding proteins, no clear match to a known RNA-binding domain was found, and RNA recognition is therefore likely mediated by a highly diverged or novel structure. We also show that 160K binds specifically to both the 77K (suppressor of forked) subunit of the cleavage factor CstF and to poly(A) polymerase (PAP). These results provide explanations for previously observed cooperative interactions between CPSF and CstF, which are responsible for poly(A) site specification, and between CPSF and PAP, which are necessary for synthesis of the poly(A) tail. Also supporting a direct role for 160K in these interactions is the fact that 160K by itself retains partial ability to cooperate with CstF in binding pre-mRNA and, unexpectedly, inhibits PAP activity in in vitro assays. We discuss the significance of these multiple functions and also a possible evolutionary link between yeast and mammalian polyadenylation suggested by the properties and sequence of 160K.},

Both the conserved chromo- and SET domains of Clr4 are required for H3 Lys9methylation in vivo. Localization of Swi6, a homolog ofDrosophila HP1, to heterochomatic regions is dependent on H3 Lys9 methylation. Moreover, an H3-specific deacetylase Clr3 and a {$\beta$}-propeller domain protein Rik1 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation by Clr4 and Swi6 localization. These data define a conserved pathway wherein sequential histone modifications establish a ``histone code'' essential for the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin assembly.}

One of these proteins, the widely expressed (throughout retinoid target tissues and in all vertebrates) and highly conserved cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP), sequesters retinol in an internal binding pocket that segregates it from the intracellular milieu. The CRBP-retinol complex appears to be the quantitatively major form of retinol in vivo, and may protect the promiscuous substrate from nonenzymatic degradation and/or non-specific enzymes. For example, at least seven types of dehydrogenases catalyze retinal synthesis from unbound retinol in vitro (NAD+ vs. NADP+ dependent, cytosolic vs. microsomal, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases vs. medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases). But only a fraction of these (some of the short-chain de-hydrogenases/reductases) have the fascinating additional ability of catalyzing retinal synthesis from CRBP-bound retinol as well. Similarly, CRBP and/or other retinoid-binding proteins function in the synthesis of retinal esters, the reduction of retinal generated from intestinal beta-carotene metabolism, and retinoic acid metabolism. The discussion details the evidence supporting an integrated model of retinoid-binding protein/metabolism. Also addressed are retinoid-androgen interactions and evidence incompatible with ethanol causing fetal alcohol syndrome by competing directly with retinol dehydrogenation to impair retinoic acid biosynthesis.},

Senescent cells can accumulate senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may provide a chromatin buffer that prevents activation of proliferation-associated genes by mitogenic transcription factors. Surprisingly, we show that the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins, which can promote tumorigenesis, accumulate on the chromatin of senescent fibroblasts and are essential structural components of SAHFs. HMGA proteins cooperate with the p16INK4a tumor suppressor to promote SAHF formation and proliferative arrest and stabilize senescence by contributing to the repression of proliferation-associated genes. These antiproliferative activities are canceled by coexpression of the HDM2 and CDK4 oncogenes, which are often coamplified with HMGA2 in human cancers. Our results identify a component of the senescence machinery that contributes to heterochromatin formation and imply that HMGA proteins also act in tumor suppressor networks. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here we comprehensively define the Drosophila female germ line epigenome throughout oogenesis and show that the oocyte has a unique, dynamic and remarkably diversified epigenome characterized by the presence of both euchromatic and heterochromatic marks. We observed that the perturbation of the oocyte's epigenome in early oogenesis, through depletion of the dKDM5 histone demethylase, results in the temporal deregulation of meiotic transcription and affects female fertility. Taken together, our results indicate that the early programming of the oocyte epigenome primes meiotic chromatin for subsequent functions in late prophase I.,  Meiotically arrested oocytes retain transcriptional ability despite chromosome condensation.

Equal parts degenerate and sex-driven, the Y has boldly rebelled against sexual recombination, one of the sacred pillars of evolution. In evolutionary terms this chromosome also seems to have adopted another of rock\&roll's mottos: living fast. Yet, it appears to have refused to die young. In this manuscript the Y chromosome will be analyzed from the intersection between structural, evolutionary and functional biology. Such integrative approach will present the Y as a highly specialized product of a series of remarkable evolutionary processes. These led to the establishment of a sex-specific genomic niche that is maintained by a complex balance between selective pressure and the genetic diversity introduced by intrachromosomal recombination. Central to this equilibrium is the "polish or perish" dilemma faced by the male-specific Y genes: either they are polished by the acquisition of male-related functions or they perish via the accumulation of inactivating mutations. Thus, understanding to what extent the idiosyncrasies of Y recombination may impact this chromosome's role in sex determination and male germline functions should be regarded as essential for added clinical insight into several male infertility phenotypes.

The cytoplasmic dynein microtubule motor complex is involved in this process. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal-D (BicD) proteins are also essential for the transport of macromolecules to the oocyte and to the apical surface of the blastoderm embryo. Hence, Egl and BicD, which have been shown to associate, may be part of a conserved core localization machinery in Drosophila, although a direct association between these molecules and the dynein motor complex has not been shown. Here we report that Egl interacts directly with Drosophila dynein light chain (Dlc), a microtubule motor component, through an Egl domain distinct from that which binds BicD. We propose that the Egl-BicD complex is loaded through Dlc onto the dynein motor complex thereby facilitating transport of cargo. Consistent with this model, point mutations that specifically disrupt Egl-Dlc association also disrupt microtubule-dependant trafficking both to and within the oocyte, resulting in a loss of oocyte fate maintenance and polarity. Our data provide a direct link between a molecule necessary for oocyte specification and the microtubule motor complex, and supports the hypothesis that microtubule-mediated transport is important for preserving oocyte fate.},

Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins.

  abstract = {Members of the novel vaccinia related kinase (VRK) protein family are characterized by notable sequence homology to the vaccinia virus-encoded B1 kinase (vvB1). wB1 plays an essential role in viral DNA replication, and Boyle and Traktman have demonstrated that VRK1 enzymes complement the replication defect of a temperature-sensitive viral mutant defective in vvB1 (Boyle, K., and Traktman, P. (2004) J. Virol. 78, 1992-2005). This mammalian kinase family comprises three members, VRK1, VRK2, and VRK3. We have annotated the gene structure for the members of this family and have characterized the enzyme activity and subcellular localization for the human and mouse proteins. VRK1 enzymes show robust autophosphorylation activity and will phosphorylate casein; VRK2 enzymes show modest autophosphorylation activity and will also phosphorylate casein. The VRK3 proteins have key amino acid substitutions that disrupt invariant motifs required for catalytic activity, rendering them enzymatically inert. The VRK1 and VRK2 proteins contain COOH-terminal extra-catalytic sequences that mediate intracellular localization. VRK1 proteins possess a basic nuclear localization signal and are indeed nuclear; the extreme C termini of the VRK2 proteins are highly hydrophobic, and the proteins are membrane-associated and colocalize with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum. The NH2-terminal region of the VRK3s contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which directs these proteins to the nucleus. Our findings provide the basis for further studies of the structure and function of this newly discovered family of protein kinases.}

The VRK orthologues encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster play an essential role in cell division; however, substrates that mediate this role have yet to be elucidated. VRK1 can complement the temperature sensitivity of a vaccinia B1 mutant, implying that VRK1 and B1 have overlapping substrate specificity. Herein, we demonstrate that B1, VRK1, and VRK2 efficiently phosphorylate the extreme N' terminus of the BAF protein (Barrier to Autointegration Factor). BAF binds to both DNA and LEM domain-containing proteins of the inner nuclear membrane; in lower eukaryotes, BAF has been shown to play an important role during the reassembly of the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of ser4 and/or thr2/thr3 abrogates the interaction of BAF with DNA and reduces its interaction with the LEM domain. Coexpression of VRK1 and GFP-BAF greatly diminishes the association of BAF with the nuclear chromatin/matrix and leads to its dispersal throughout the cell. Cumulatively, our data suggest that the VRKs may modulate the association of BAF with nuclear components and hence play a role in maintaining appropriate nuclear architecture. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The American Society for Cell Biology.}

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that specific ribosomal proteins are associated with chromatin in a histone H1-dependent manner. Overexpression of either histone H1 or ribosomal protein L22 in Drosophila cells resulted in global suppression of the same set of genes, while depletion of H1 and L22 caused up-regulation of tested genes, suggesting that H1 and ribosomal proteins are essential for transcriptional gene repression. Overall, this study provides evidence for a previously undefined link between ribosomal proteins and chromatin, and suggests a role for this association in transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes. \textcopyright{} 2006 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Recent studies demonstrated that viable mouse pups could be obtained from in vitro differentiated stem cells suggesting that translation of these results to human is closer.

KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A), a member of the KDM5 protein family, is an H3K4 demethylase, previously implicated in the regulation of transcription and differentiation. Here, we show that KDM5A is physically and functionally associated with two histone deacetylase complexes. Immunoaffinity purification of KDM5A confirmed a previously described association with the SIN3B-containing histone deacetylase complex and revealed an association with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Sucrose density gradient and sequential immunoprecipitation analyses further confirmed the stable association of KDM5A with these two histone deacetylase complexes. KDM5A depletion led to changes in the expression of hundreds of genes, two-thirds of which were also controlled by CHD4, the NuRD catalytic subunit. Gene ontology analysis confirmed that the genes commonly regulated by both KDM5A and CHD4 were categorized as developmentally regulated genes. ChIP analyses suggested that CHD4 modulates H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and coding regions of target genes. We further demonstrated that the Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of KDM5 and CHD4 function in the same pathway during vulva development. These results suggest that KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes.}

Male and female germ cells are usually produced during spermatogenesis and oogenesis, which take place in the testis and the ovary, respectively. Spermatogenesis involves the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells into spermatocytes via mitotic cell division and the production of haploid spermatids from the tetraploid primary spermatocytes via meiotic cell division. Spermatids subsequently give rise to spermatozoa in the final phase of spermatogenesis, called spermiogenesis. These fundamental steps, where mitotic proliferation precedes meiosis during spermatogenesis, are observed in a wide variety of organisms. However, developing a comprehensive understanding of the cell biology and genetics of spermatogenesis is difficult for most species because it occurs within a complex testicular environment characterized by the intimate association of developing sperm with accessory cells.

Among PIWI-clade proteins in Drosophila, Piwi transcriptionally silences its targets through interactions with cofactors, including Panoramix (Panx) and forms heterochromatin characterized by H3K9me3 and H1. Here, we identified Nxf2, a nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) variant, as a protein that forms complexes with Piwi, Panx, and p15. Panx?Nxf2?P15 complex formation is necessary in the silencing by stabilizing protein levels of Nxf2 and Panx. Notably, ectopic targeting of Nxf2 initiates co-transcriptional repression of the target reporter in a manner independent of H3K9me3 marks or H1. However, continuous silencing requires HP1a and H1. In addition, Nxf2 directly interacts with target TE transcripts in a Piwi-dependent manner. These findings suggest a model in which the Panx?Nxf2?P15 complex enforces the association of Piwi with target transcripts to trigger co-transcriptional repression, prior to heterochromatin formation in the nuclear piRNA pathway. Our results provide an unexpected connection between an NXF variant and small RNA-mediated co-transcriptional silencing.},

The H3 tail was shown to partake in intranucleosomal interactions by restricting the DNA breathing motion and compacting the nucleosome. The H3 tail effects were mostly independent of the ionic strength and valency of the ions. The H4 tail was shown to not greatly affect the nucleosome conformation, but did slightly influence the relative population of the preferred conformation. The role of the H4 tail varied depending on the valency and ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a primary role in H4 tail interactions. Interestingly, despite the H4 tail's lack of influence, when H3 and H4 tails were simultaneously clipped, a more dramatic effect was seen than when only H3 or H4 tails were clipped. The combinatorial effect of H3 and H4 tail truncation suggests a potential mechanism by which various combinations of histone tail modifications can be used to control accessibility of DNA-binding proteins to nucleosomal DNA. \textcopyright{} 2013 Biophysical Society.}

Drosophila TSSs have generally been mapped by individual experiments; the low number of accurately mapped TSSs has limited analysis of promoter sequence motifs and the training of computational prediction tools. RESULTS: We identified TSS candidates for about 2,000 Drosophila genes by aligning 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cap-trapped cDNA libraries to the genome, while applying stringent criteria concerning coverage and 5'-end distribution. Examination of the sequences flanking these TSSs revealed the presence of well-known core promoter motifs such as the TATA box, the initiator and the downstream promoter element (DPE). We also define, and assess the distribution of, several new motifs prevalent in core promoters, including what appears to be a variant DPE motif. Among the prevalent motifs is the DNA-replication-related element DRE, recently shown to be part of the recognition site for the TBP-related factor TRF2. Our TSS set was then used to retrain the computational promoter predictor McPromoter, allowing us to improve the recognition performance to over 50\% sensitivity and 40\% specificity. We compare these computational results to promoter prediction in vertebrates. CONCLUSIONS: There are relatively few recognizable binding sites for previously known general transcription factors in Drosophila core promoters. However, we identified several new motifs enriched in promoter regions. We were also able to significantly improve the performance of computational TSS prediction in Drosophila.},

Here we present the cloning and characterization of bgcn. The predicted Bgcn protein is related to the DExH-box family of RNA-dependent helicases but lacks critical residues for ATPase and helicase functions. Expression of the bgcn gene is extremely limited in ovaries but, significantly, bgcn mRNA is expressed in a very limited number of germline cells, including the stem cells. Also, mutations in bgcn dominantly enhance a barn mutant phenotype, further corroborating the interdependence of these two genes' functions.

To characterize spermatogenesis in c-kit/SCF mutants and to understand the role of c-kit signal transduction in spermatogonial stem cells, the existence, proliferation, and differentiation of spermatogonia were examined in the W/Wv mutant mouse testis. In the present study, some of the W/Wv mutant testes completely lacked spermatogonia, and many of the remaining testes contained only a few spermatogonia. Examination of the proliferative activity of the W/Wv mutant spermatogonia by transplantation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-labeled W/Wv spermatogonia into the seminiferous tubules of normal SCF (W/Wv) or SCF mutant (Sl/Sld) mice demonstrated that the W/Wv spermatogonia had the ability to settle and proliferate, but not to differentiate, in the recipient seminiferous tubules. Although the germ cells in the adult W/Wv testis were c-kit-receptor protein-negative undifferentiated type A spermatogonia, the juvenile germ cells were able to differentiate into spermatogonia that expressed the c-kit-receptor protein. Furthermore, differentiated germ cells with the c-kit-receptor protein on the cell surface could be induced by GnRH antagonist treatment, even in the adult W/Wv testis. These results indicate that all the spermatogonial stem cell characteristics of settlement, proliferation, and differentiation can be demonstrated without stimulating the c-kit-receptor signal. The c-kit/SCF signal transduction system appears to be necessary for the maintenance and proliferation of differentiated c-kit receptor-positive spermatogonia but not for the initial step of spermatogonial cell differentiation.}

We attempted to understand the mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest before meiosis. Methods: We induced dsRNAs against the nucleoporin mRNAs using the Gal4/UAS system in Drosophila. Results: The cell cycle of the Nup62-depleted cells was arrested before meiosis without CDK1 activation. The ectopic over-expression of CycB, but not constitutively active CDK1, resulted in partial rescue from the arrest. CycB continued to exist in the nuclei of Nup62-depleted cells and cells depleted of exportin encoded by emb. Protein complexes containing CycB, Emb, and Nup62 were observed in premeiotic spermatocytes. CycB, which had temporally entered the nucleus, was associated with Emb, and the complex was transported back to the cytoplasm through the central channel, interacting with the Nup62 complex. Conclusion: We proposed that CycB is exported with Emb through the channel interacting with the Nup62 complex before the onset of meiosis. The nuclear export ensures the modification and formation of sufficient CycB-CDK1 in the cytoplasm.},

Here, we examine the roles of the mammalian Rpl22, finding that Rpl22 -/- mice have only subtle phenotypes with no significant translation defects. We find that in the Rpl22 -/- mouse there is a compensatory increase in Rpl22-like1 (Rpl22l1) expression and incorporation into ribosomes. Consistent with the hypothesis that either ribosomal protein can support translation, knockdown of Rpl22l1 impairs growth of cells lacking Rpl22. Mechanistically, Rpl22 regulates Rpl22l1 directly by binding to an internal hairpin structure and repressing its expression. We propose that ribosome specificity may exist in mammals, providing evidence that one ribosomal protein can influence composition of the ribosome by regulating its own paralog. \textcopyright{} 2013 O'Leary et al.}

  abstract = {Induction of gene expression in yeast and human cells involves changes in the histone modifications associated with promoters. Here we identify a histone H3 endopeptidase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that may regulate these events. The endopeptidase cleaves H3 after Ala21, generating a histone that lacks the first 21 residues and shows a preference for H3 tails carrying repressive modifications. In vivo, the H3 N terminus is clipped, specifically within the promoters of genes following the induction of transcription. H3 clipping precedes the process of histone eviction seen when genes become fully active. A truncated H3 product is not generated in yeast carrying a mutation of the endopeptidase recognition site (H3 Q19A L20A) and gene induction is defective in these cells. These findings identify clipping of H3 tails as a previously uncharacterized modification of promoter-bound nucleosomes, which may result in the localized clearing of repressive signals during the induction of gene expression.}

The dorsal appendages, or respiratory filaments, of these eggshells display a remarkable interspecies variation in number and shape, and the epithelial patterning underlying the formation of these structures is an area of active research. To extend the analysis of dorsal appendage formation to include morphogenesis, we developed an improved 3D image reconstruction approach. This approach revealed considerable interspecies variation in the cell shape changes and neighbor exchanges underlying appendage formation. Specifically, although the appendage floor in Drosophila melanogaster is formed through spatially ordered neighbor exchanges, the same structure in Scaptodrosophila pattersoni is formed through extreme changes in cell shape, whereas Drosophila funebris appears to display a combination of both cellular mechanisms. Furthermore, localization patterns of Par3/Bazooka suggest a self-organized, cell polarity-based origin for the variability of appendage number in S. pattersoni. Our results suggest that species deploy different combinations of apically and basally driven mechanisms to convert a two-dimensional primordium into a three-dimensional structure, and provide new directions for exploring the molecular origins of interspecies morphological variation.},

Monoubiquitination of mammalian SETDB1 is necessary for the HMT activity. Here, using cultured ovarian somatic cells, we show that Egg is monoubiquitinated and phosphorylated but that only monoubiquitination is required for piRNA-mediated transposon repression. Egg monoubiquitination occurs in the nucleus. Egg has its own nuclear localization signal, and the nuclear import of Egg is Wde-independent. Wde recruits Egg to the chromatin at target gene silencing loci, but their interaction is monoubiquitin-independent. The abundance of nuclear Egg is governed by that of nuclear Wde. These results illuminate essential roles of nuclear monoubiquitination of Egg and the role of Wde in piRNA-mediated transposon repression.},

Recent studies have started to uncover the assembly process, and evidence has been accumulating that postmitotic and interphase NPC assembly use fundamentally different mechanisms; the duration, structural intermediates, and regulation by molecular players are different and different types of membrane deformation are involved. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these two modes of NPC assembly and discuss the structural and regulatory steps that might drive the assembly processes. We furthermore integrate understanding of NPC assembly with the mechanisms for rapid nuclear growth in embryos and, finally, speculate on the evolutionary origin of the NPC implied by the presence of two distinct assembly mechanisms.},

Clutch size correlated with the pluripotency grade of mouse embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Recently, it was also shown that regions of the chromatin containing activating epigenetic marks were composed of small and dispersed chromatin nanodomains with lower DNA density compared to the larger silenced domains. Overall, these results suggest that clutch size may regulate DNA packing density and gene activity. To directly test this model, we carried out 3D, two-color super-resolution microscopy of histones and DNA with and without increased histone tail acetylation. Our results showed that lower percentage of DNA was associated with nucleosome clutches in hyperacetylated cells. We further showed that the radius and compaction level of clutch-associated DNA decreased in hyperacetylated cells, especially in regions containing several neighboring clutches. Importantly, this change was independent of clutch size but dependent on the acetylation state of the clutch. Our results directly link the epigenetic state of nucleosome clutches to their DNA packing density. Our results further provide in vivo support to previous in vitro models that showed a disruption of nucleosome-DNA interactions upon hyperacetylation.}

The stages of meiosis are normal by cytological criteria, and the timing of the meiotic divisions is similar to that of eggs activated in vivo. We use this system to examine the role of protein synthesis in regulating the progression of meiosis and the maintenance of the metaphase I arrest. We find that synthesis of new proteins after metaphase I is not required for anaphase I, meiosis II, or the decondensation of the meiotic products. Also, continued protein synthesis is not required to maintain the metaphase I arrest. New protein synthesis is required, however, for proper chromatin recondensation after meiosis.}

In humans, genetic deletion analysis of "sex-reversed" individuals has identified a small portion of the Y chromosome necessary and sufficient to induce testicular differentiation of the bipotential gonad. We report the cloning of a 230-kilobase segment of the human Y chromosome that contains some or all of the testis-determining factor gene (TDF), the master sex-determining locus. The cloned region spans the deletion in a female who carries all but 160 kilobases of the Y. Certain DNA sequences within this region were highly conserved during evolution; homologs occur on the Y chromosomes of all mammals examined. In particular, homologous sequences are found within the sex-determining region of the mouse Y chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of this conserved DNA on the human Y chromosome suggests that it encodes a protein with multiple "finger" domains, as first described in frog transcription factor IIIA. The encoded protein probably binds to nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner, and may regulate transcription. Very similar DNA sequences occur on the X chromosome of humans and other mammals. We discuss the possibility that the Y-encoded finger protein is the testis-determining factor, and propose models of sex determination accommodating the finding of a related locus on the X chromosome. The presence of similar sequences in birds suggests a possible role not only in the XX XY sex determination system of mammals, but also in the ZZ ZW system of birds. \textcopyright{} 1987.}

Nonetheless, deleting one paralog of most ribosomal protein gene pairs results in a variety of phenotypes not observed when the other paralog is deleted. To determine whether paralog-specific phenotypes associated with deleting RPL7A or RPL7B stem from distinct functions or different levels of the encoded isoforms, the coding region and introns of one paralog, including an intron-embedded snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) gene, were exchanged with that of the other paralog. Among mutants harboring a single native or chimeric RPL7 allele, expression from the RPL7A locus exceeded that from the RPL7B locus, and more Rpl7a was expressed from either locus than Rpl7b. Phenotypic differences in tunicamycin sensitivity, ASH1 mRNA localization, and mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon were strongly correlated with Rpl7 and ribosome levels, but not with the Rpl7 or snoRNA isoform expressed. Although Ty1 RNA is cotranslationally localized, depletion of Rpl7 minimally affected synthesis of Ty1 Gag protein, but strongly influenced Ty1 RNA localization. Unlike the other processes studied, Ty1 cDNA accumulation was influenced by both the level and isoform of Rpl7 or snoRNA expressed. These cellular processes had different minimal threshold values for Rpl7 and ribosome levels, but all were functional when isoforms of either paralog were expressed from the RPL7A locus or both RPL7 loci. This study illustrates the broad range of phenotypes that can result from depleting ribosomes to different levels.},

Females and males (both with and without gonads), dissected testis and ovary, females and males with genetically ablated germlines, and sex-transformed flies were sampled. CONCLUSIONS: Using any of a number of criteria, we find extensive sex-biased expression in adults. The majority of cases of sex differential gene expression are attributable to the germ cells. There is also a large class of genes with soma-biased expression. There is little germline-biased expression indicating that nearly all genes with germline expression also show sex-bias. Monte Carlo simulations show that some genes with sex-biased expression are non-randomly distributed in the genome.},

These genes were found to be stably associated with nuclear pores before and after activation. Although changing levels of Nup98 disrupted enhancer-promoter contacts, it did not affect ongoing transcription but instead compromised subsequent transcriptional activation or transcriptional memory. In support of the enhancer-looping role, we found Nup98 to gain and retain physical interactions with architectural proteins upon stimulation with ecdysone.

Histone lysine methyltransferases that have been identified to date possess the evolutionarily conserved SET or Dot1-like domains. We previously reported the identification of a new multi-subunit histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase lacking homology to the SET or Dot1 family of histone lysine methyltransferases. This enzymatic activity requires a complex that includes WRAD (WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30), a complex that is part of the MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia protein-1) core complex but that also exists independently of MLL1 in the cell. Here, we report that the minimal complex required for WRAD enzymatic activity includes WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L and that DPY-30, although not required for enzymatic activity, increases the histone substrate specificity of the WRAD complex. We also show that WRAD requires zinc for catalytic activity, displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine. In addition, we demonstrate that WRAD preferentially methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 within the context of the H3/H4 tetramer but does not methylate nucleosomal histone H3 on its own. In contrast, we find that MLL1 and WRAD are required for nucleosomal histone H3 methylation, and we provide evidence suggesting that each plays distinct structural and catalytic roles in the recognition and methylation of a nucleosome substrate. Our results indicate that WRAD is a new H3K4 methyltransferase with functions that include regulating the substrate and product specificities of the MLL1 core complex. \textcopyright{} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

Three molecular mechanisms explain assembly of diverse TBP-TATA element complexes.

  abstract = {Determining chromatin-associated protein localization across the genome has provided insight into the functions of DNA-binding proteins and their connections to disease. However, established protocols requiring large quantities of cell or tissue samples currently limit applications for clinical and biomedical research in this field. Furthermore, most technologies have been optimized to assess abundant histone protein localization, prohibiting the investigation of nonhistone protein localization in low cell numbers. We recently described a protocol to profile chromatin-associated protein localization in as low as one cell: ultra-low-input cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (uliCUT\&RUN). Optimized from chromatin immunocleavage and CUT\&RUN, uliCUT\&RUN is a tethered enzyme-based protocol that utilizes a combination of recombinant protein, antibody recognition and stringent purification to selectively target proteins of interest and isolate the associated DNA. Performed in native conditions, uliCUT\&RUN profiles protein localization to chromatin with low input and high precision. Compared with other profiling technologies, uliCUT\&RUN can determine nonhistone protein chromatin occupancies in low cell numbers, permitting the investigation into the molecular functions of a range of DNA-binding proteins within rare samples. From sample preparation to sequencing library submission, the uliCUT\&RUN protocol takes {$<$}2 d to perform, with the accompanying data analysis timeline dependent on experience level.},

RBPs recognize their RNA target via specific binding sites on the RNA. Predicting the binding sites of RBPs is known to be a major challenge. We present a new webserver, RBPmap, freely accessible through the website http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/ for accurate prediction and mapping of RBP binding sites. RBPmap has been developed specifically for mapping RBPs in human, mouse and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, though it supports other organisms too. RBPmap enables the users to select motifs from a large database of experimentally defined motifs. In addition, users can provide any motif of interest, given as either a consensus or a PSSM. The algorithm for mapping the motifs is based on a Weighted-Rank approach, which considers the clustering propensity of the binding sites and the overall tendency of regulatory regions to be conserved. In addition, RBPmap incorporates a position-specific background model, designed uniquely for different genomic regions, such as splice sites, 5' and 3' UTRs, non-coding RNA and intergenic regions. RBPmap was tested on high-throughput RNA-binding experiments and was proved to be highly accurate. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s).}

In eukaryotes, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with active chromatin and gene expression. We recently found that plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of tumour suppressor ING2 (inhibitor of growth 2) binds H3K4me3 and represents a new family of modules that target this epigenetic mark. The molecular mechanism of H3K4me3 recognition, however, remains unknown. Here we report a 2.0 \textbackslash AA resolution structure of the mouse ING2 PHD finger in complex with a histone H3 peptide trimethylated at lysine 4. The H3K4me3 tail is bound in an extended conformation in a deep and extensive binding site consisting of elements that are conserved among the ING family of proteins. The trimethylammonium group of Lys 4 is recognized by the aromatic side chains of Y215 and W238 residues, whereas the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding and complementary surface interactions, involving Ala 1, Arg 2, Thr 3 and Thr 6 of the peptide, account for the PHD finger's high specificity and affinity. Substitution of the binding site residues disrupts H3K4me3 interaction in vitro and impairs the ability of ING2 to induce apoptosis in vivo. Strong binding of other ING and YNG PHD fingers suggests that the recognition of H3K4me3 histone code is a general feature of the ING/YNG proteins. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this novel function of PHD fingers provides a basis for deciphering the role of the ING family of tumour suppressors in chromatin regulation and signalling. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

Drosophila P-TEFb was identified recently as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK9) paired with a cyclin subunit (cyclin T). We demonstrate here the cloning of multiple cyclin subunits of human P-TEFb (T1 and T2). Cyclin T2 has two forms (T2a and T2b) because of alternative splicing. Both cyclin T1 and T2 are ubiquitously expressed. Immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments carried out on HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) indicated that cyclin T1 and T2 were associated with CDK9 in a mutually exclusive manner and that almost all CDK9 was associated with either cyclin T1 or T2. Recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1, CDK9/cyclin T2a, and CDK9/cyclin T2b produced in Sf9 cells possessed DRB-sensitive kinase activity and functioned in transcription elongation in vitro. Either cyclin T1 or T2 was required to activate CDK9, and the truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the cyclin reduced, but did not eliminate, P-TEFb activity. Cotransfection experiments indicated that all three CDK9/cyclin combinations dramatically activated the CMV promoter.},

The cap-binding complex elF4F and the factors elF4A and elF4B are required for binding of 43S complexes (comprising a 40S subunit, elF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi and elF3) to the 5{${'}$} end of capped mRNA but are not sufficient to promote ribosomal scanning to the initiation codon. elF1A enhances the ability of elF1 to dissociate aberrantly assembled complexes from mRNA, and these factors synergistically mediate 48S complex assembly at the initiation codon. Joining of 48S complexes to 60S subunits to form 80S ribosomes requires elF5B, which has an essential ribosome-dependent GTPase activity and hydrolysis of elF2-bound GTP induced by elF5. Initiation on a few mRNAs is cap-independent and occurs instead by internal ribosomal entry. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus epitomize distinct mechanisms of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated initiation. The elF4A and elF4G subunits of elF4F bind immediately upstream of the EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of 43S complexes. EMCV initiation does not involve scanning and does not require elF1, elF1A, and the elF4E subunit of elF4F. Initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional noncanonical initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of elF4A/4G. Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is even simpler: 43S complexes containing only elF2 and elF3 bind directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction of the IRES and the 40S subunit.}

The mechanism of Notch signalling is thought to require cleavage of the receptor in response to ligand binding, movement of the receptor's intracellular domain to the nucleus, and binding of that intracellular domain to a CSL (for CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, LAG-1) protein. Here we identify LAG-3, a glutamine-rich protein that forms a ternary complex together with the LAG-1 DNA-binding protein and the receptor's intracellular domain. Receptors with mutant ankyrin repeats that abrogate signal transduction are incapable of complex formation both in yeast and in vitro. Using RNA interference, we find that LAG-3 activity is crucial in caenorhabditis elegans for both GLP-1 and LIN-12 signalling. LAG-3 is a potent transcriptional activator in yeast, and a Myc-tagged LAG-3 is predominantly nuclear in C. elegans. We propose that GLP-1 and LIN-12 promote signalling by recruiting LAG-3 to target promoters, where it functions as a transcriptional activator.}

However, the mechanism by which introns regulate the expression of RPGs and their impact on the synthesis of ribosomal proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that introns determine the ratio of ribosomal protein isoforms through asymmetric paralog-specific regulation of splicing. Exchanging the introns and 3{${'}$} untranslated regions of the duplicated RPS9 genes altered the splicing efficiency and changed the ratio of the ribosomal protein isoforms. Mutational analysis of the RPS9 genes indicated that splicing is regulated by variations in the intron structure and the 3{${'}$} untranslated region. Together these data suggest that preferential splicing of duplicated RPGs provides a means for adjusting the ratio of different ribosomal protein isoforms, while maintaining the overall expression level of each ribosomal protein.}

This complex binds to genes with a preference for exons on the male X chromosome with a 3' bias, and it targets most expressed genes on the X chromosome. However, a number of genes are expressed but not targeted by the complex. High affinity sites seem to be responsible for initial recruitment of the complex to the X chromosome, but the targeting to and within individual genes is poorly understood.Results: We have extensively examined X chromosome sequence variation within five types of gene features (promoters, 5' UTRs, coding sequences, introns, 3' UTRs) and intergenic sequences, and assessed its potential involvement in dosage compensation. Presented results show that: the X chromosome has a distinct sequence composition within its gene features; some of the detected variation correlates with genes targeted by the MSL-complex; the insulator protein BEAF-32 preferentially binds upstream of MSL-bound genes; BEAF-32 and MOF co-localizes in promoters; and that bound genes have a distinct sequence composition that shows a 3' bias within coding sequence.Conclusions: Although, many strongly bound genes are close to a high affinity site neither our promoter motif nor our coding sequence signatures show any correlation to HAS. Based on the results presented here, we believe that there are sequences in the promoters and coding sequences of targeted genes that have the potential to direct the secondary spreading of the MSL-complex to nearby genes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Philip et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The essential function of DSmurf is restricted to its action on the DPP pathway. DSmurf has two distinct, possibly mechanistically separate, functions in controlling DPP signaling. Prior to gastrulation, DSmurf mutations cause a spatial increase in the DPP gradient, as evidenced by ventrolateral expansion in expression domains of target genes representing all known signaling thresholds.

Using inhibitors of cytoskeletal function, we find that microtubules, but not microfilaments, are required for localization of these mRNAs during oogenesis, results similar to those described earlier for bicoid RNA. However, the RNAs show a differential sensitivity to microtubule inhibitors. Anterior localization of Bicaudal-D, fs (1) K10, and orb RNAs is completely disrupted following even mild drug treatments. bicoid RNA localization is intermediate in its response to microtubule drugs, while oskar RNA localization is much more resistant. In addition, the localized RNAs respond differently to taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent. The differences among these RNAs suggest that factors other than microtubules are required to maintain the positions of localized RNAs in the oocyte. Microtubules are also required for the preferential accumulation of these transcripts in the previtellogenic oocyte, consistent with the idea that these are transported by a microtubule-dependent mechanism to the oocyte. \textcopyright{} 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.}

The lack of precise transcription start site (TSS) locations linked with expression information has impeded genome-wide characterization of the interaction between TATA and the pre-initiation complex. Results: Using a comprehensive set of 5.66 \texttimes{} 106 sequenced 5{${'}$} cDNA ends from diverse tissues mapped to the mouse genome, we found that the TATA-TSS distance is correlated with the tissue specificity of the downstream transcript. To achieve tissue-specific regulation, the TATA box position relative to the TSS is constrained to a narrow window (-32 to -29), where positions -31 and -30 are the optimal positions for achieving high tissue specificity. Slightly larger spacings can be accommodated only when there is no optimally spaced initiation-signal; in contrast, the TATA box like motifs found downstream of position -28 are generally nonfunctional. The strength of the TATA binding protein-DNA interaction plays a subordinate role to spacing in terms of tissue specificity. Furthermore, promoters with different TATA-TSS spacings have distinct features in terms of consensus sequence around the initiation site and distribution-of alternative TSSs. Unexpectedly, promoters that have two dominant, consecutive TSSs are TATA depleted and have a novel GGG initiation site consensus. Conclusion: In this report we present the most comprehensive characterization of TATA-TSS spacing and functionality to date. The coupling of spacing to tissue specificity at the transcriptome level provides important clues as to the function of core promoters and the choice of TSS by the pre-initiation complex. \textcopyright{} 2006 Ponjavic et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

This mechanism, which proposes that the ovary has cells capable of renewing the follicular reserve, has been described for various species of mammals. The first evidence was found in prosimians and humans. However, these findings were not considered relevant because the predominant dogma for reproductive biology at the time was that of Zuckerman. This dogma states that female mammals are born with finite numbers of oocytes that decline throughout postnatal life. Currently, the concept of neo-oogenesis has gained momentum due to the discovery of cells with mitotic activity in adult ovaries of various mammalian species (mice, humans, rhesus monkeys, domestic animals such as pigs, and wild animals such as bats). Despite these reports, the concept of neo-oogenesis has not been widely accepted by the scientific community, generating much criticism and speculation about its accuracy because it has been impossible to reproduce some evidence. This controversy has led to the creation of two positions: one in favour of neo-oogenesis and the other against it. Various animal models have been used in support of both camps, including both classic laboratory animals and domestic and wild animals. The aim of this review is to critically present the current literature on the subject and to evaluate the arguments pro and contra neo-oogenesis in mammals.},

  abstract = {Background: The Drosophila Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex contains chromatin modifying enzymes and non-coding roX RNA. It paints the male X at hundreds of bands where it acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16. This epigenetic mark increases expression from the single male X chromosome approximately twofold above what gene-specific factors produce from each female X chromosome. This equalises X-linked gene expression between the sexes. Previous screens for components of dosage compensation relied on a distinctive male-specific lethal phenotype.Results: Here, we report a new strategy relying upon an unusual male-specific mosaic eye pigmentation phenotype produced when the MSL complex acts upon autosomal roX1 transgenes. Screening the second chromosome identified at least five loci, two of which are previously described components of the MSL complex. We focused our analysis on the modifier alleles of MSL1 and MLE (for 'maleless'). The MSL1 lesions are not simple nulls, but rather alter the PEHE domain that recruits the MSL3 chromodomain and MOF ('males absent on first') histone acetyltransferase subunits to the complex. These mutants are compromised in their ability to recruit MSL3 and MOF, dosage compensate the X, and support long distance spreading from roX1 transgenes. Yet, paradoxically, they were isolated because they somehow increase MSL complex activity immediately around roX1 transgenes in combination with wild-type MSL1 subunits.Conclusions: We propose that these diverse phenotypes arise from perturbations in assembly of MSL subunits onto nascent roX transcripts. This strategy is a promising alternative route for identifying previously unknown components of the dosage compensation pathway and novel alleles of known MSL proteins. \textcopyright{} 2010 Prabhakaran and Kelley; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor Domino is also required in this tissue for adult stem cell maintenance possibly by regulating the incorporation of His2Av into chromatin. Interestingly, although expression of His2Av was ubiquitous, its function was dispensable for germline and cyst cell differentiation, suggesting a specific role for this non-canonical histone in maintaining the stem cell state in these lineages. \textcopyright{} 2013 Morillo Prado et al.}

It contains lamins and lamin-associated proteins, including many integral proteins of the INM, chromatin modifying proteins, transcriptional repressors and structural proteins. A fraction of lamins is also present in the nucleoplasm, where it forms stable complexes and is associated with specific nucleoplasmic proteins. The lamins and their associated proteins are required for most nuclear activities, mitosis and for linking the nucleoplasm to all major cytoskeletal networks in the cytoplasm. Mutations in nuclear lamins and their associated proteins cause about 20 different diseases that are collectively called laminopathies'. This review concentrates mainly on lamins, their structure and their roles in DNA replication, chromatin organization, adult stem cell differentiation, aging, tumorogenesis and the lamin mutations leading to laminopathic diseases. \textcopyright{} 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Then, the transcript is cleaved at the poly(A) signal to release the messenger RNA. The remaining transcript is selectively unraveled and degraded. This induces critical conformational changes in the heart of the enzyme that trigger termination. Termination can also occur at variable positions along the gene and so prevent aberrant transcript formation or intentionally make different transcripts. These may form multiple messenger RNAs with altered regulatory properties or encode different proteins. Finally, termination can be perturbed to achieve particular cellular needs or blocked in cancer or virally infected cells. In such cases, failure to terminate transcription can spell disaster for the cell.}

Although active centromeric transcription has been documented for over a decade, the role of centromeric transcription or transcripts has been elusive. Here, we report that centromeric {$\alpha$}-satellite transcription is dependent on RNA Polymerase II and occurs at late mitosis into early G1, concurrent with the timing of new CENP-A assembly. Inhibition of RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription abrogates the recruitment of CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP to native human centromeres. Biochemical characterization of CENP-A associated RNAs reveals a 1.3 kb molecule that originates from centromeres, which physically interacts with the soluble pre-assembly HJURP/ CENP-A complex in vivo, and whose down-regulation leads to the loss of CENP-A and HJURP at centromeres. This study describes a novel function for human centromeric long non-coding RNAs in the recruitment of HJURP and CENP-A, implicating RNA-based chaperone targeting in histone variant assembly.}

Until recently, it was thought that the general transcriptional machinery was largely invariant and relied on a single TBP, whereas a large and diverse collection of activators and repressors were primarily responsible for imparting specificity to transcription initiation. However, it now appears that the 'basal' transcriptional machinery also contributes to specificity via tissue- specific versions of TBP-associated factors as well as a tissue-specific TBP- related factor (TRF1) responsible for gene selectivity in Drosophila. Here we report the cloning of a TBP-related factor (TRF2) that is found in humans, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other metazoans. Like TRF1 and TBP, TRF2 binds transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) and TFIIB and appears to be part of a larger protein complex. TRF2's primary amino acid structure suggests divergence in the putative DNA binding domain, and not surprisingly, it fails to bind to DNA containing canonical TATA boxes. Most importantly, TRF2 is associated with loci on Drosophila chromosomes distinct from either TBP or TRF1, so it may have different promoter specificity and regulate a select subset of genes. These findings suggest that metazoans have evolved multiple TBPs to accommodate the vast increase in genes and expression patterns during development and cellular differentiation.},

Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes. We show that the MSL complex regulates nucleosome positioning at HAS, therefore acting locally rather than influencing the overall chromosomal architecture. We propose that the sex-independent, three-dimensional conformation of the X chromosome poises it for exploitation by the MSL complex, thereby facilitating spreading in males.}

Mof is the enzymatic subunit of two different HAT complexes, MSL and NSL. The individual contribution of MSL and NSL to transcription regulation in mESCs is not well understood. Our genome-wide analysis show that i) MSL and NSL bind to specific and common sets of expressed genes, ii) NSL binds exclusively at promoters, iii) while MSL binds in gene bodies. Nsl1 regulates proliferation and cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs, is enriched at many mESC-specific and bivalent genes. MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in mESCs, while developmental genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. Thus, NSL and MSL HAT complexes differentially regulate specific sets of expressed genes in mESCs and during differentiation.Embryonic stem cells are special cells that have the ability to become many different types of cells, such as skin, muscle, or neuronal cells. This process is called differentiation. They can also undergo a process called self-renewal to produce more embryonic stem cells. These processes are controlled by a complex network of enzymes, and the production of these enzymes depends on various genes within the organism being expressed as proteins.The DNA that holds the genetic information inside cells spends most of its time wrapped around proteins called histones: this allows the DNA molecules\textemdash which can be up to several metres long in some species\textemdash to fit inside the cell nucleus; it also protects the DNA molecules, which are quite fragile, from damage. Enzymes that attach chemical groups called acetyl groups to histones have a central role in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Mof is an enzyme that attaches an acetyl group to a specific position in a particular histone. It is a subunit within two larger protein complexes that were originally identified in flies: the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which is only found in male flies, and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which is found in both male and female flies. These complexes have been widely studied in flies, and the role of the Mof enzyme is also reasonably well understood in mammals. However, the roles of the MSL and NSL protein complexes in mammals are not fully understood.Ravens et al. have now used a combination of a technique called ChIP-seq (which can identify binding sites anywhere in the genome) and genetic `knock down' experiments to explore the roles of these two complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells.There is some overlap between the genes that the complexes act on. However, NSL acts on some genes than MSL does not act on, and vice versa. NSL mostly acts on genes that have `housekeeping' functions and are expressed in many different cell types. MSL binds more to genes that are specific to embryonic stem cells, and acts on genes required for the development of neuronal progenitor cells. This means that NSL regulates the growth of embryonic stem cells, whereas MSL controls their development and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Background: Tip60 (KAT5) is the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) of the mammalian Tip60/NuA4 complex. While Tip60 is important for early mouse development and mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) pluripotency, the function of Tip60 as reflected in a genome-wide context is not yet well understood. Results: Gel filtration of nuclear mESCs extracts indicate incorporation of Tip60 into large molecular complexes and exclude the existence of large quantities of "free" Tip60 within the nuclei of ESCs. Thus, monitoring of Tip60 binding to the genome should reflect the behaviour of Tip60-containing complexes. The genome-wide mapping of Tip60 binding in mESCs by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) shows that the Tip60 complex is present at promoter regions of predominantly active genes that are bound by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and contain the H3K4me3 histone mark. The coactivator HAT complexes, Tip60- and Mof (KAT8)-containing (NSL and MSL), show a global overlap at promoters, whereas distinct binding profiles at enhancers suggest different regulatory functions of each essential HAT complex. Interestingly, Tip60 enrichment peaks at about 200 bp downstream of the transcription start sites suggesting a function for the Tip60 complexes in addition to histone acetylation. The comparison of genome-wide binding profiles of Tip60 and c-Myc, a somatic cell reprogramming factor that binds predominantly to active genes in mESCs, demonstrate that Tip60 and c-Myc co-bind at 50-60 \% of their binding sites. We also show that the Tip60 complex binds to a subset of bivalent developmental genes and defines a set of mESC-specific enhancer as well as super-enhancer regions. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the Tip60 complex functions as a global transcriptional co-activator at most active Pol II promoters, co-regulates the ESC-specific c-Myc network, important for ESC self-renewal and cell metabolism and acts at a subset of active distal regulatory elements, or super enhancers, in mESCs.},

Germ cells show extensive epigenetic programming in preparation for the generation of the totipotent state, which in turn leads to the establishment of pluripotent cells in blastocysts. The latter are the cells from which pluripotent embryonic stem cells are derived and maintained in culture. Following blastocyst implantation, postimplantation epiblast cells develop, which give rise to all somatic cells as well as primordial germ cells, the precursors of sperm and eggs. Pluripotent stem cells in culture can be induced to undergo differentiation into somatic cells and germ cells in culture. Understanding the natural cycles of epigenetic reprogramming that occur in the germline will allow the generation of better and more versatile stem cells for both therapeutic and research purposes., In totipotent and pluripotent cells, epigenetic marks are plastic and erasable. Understanding these unique characteristics will allow the development of better stem cells for therapeutic and research purposes.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that at least three nonoverlapping regions of the human Y chromosome - AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc ("azoospermia factors" a, b, and c) - are essential for normal spermatogenesis. These intervals are defined by interstitial Y-chromosome deletions that impair or extinguish spermatogenesis. Deletion breakpoints, mechanisms, and lengths, as well as inventories of affected genes, have been elucidated for deletions of AZFa and of AZFc but not for deletions of AZFb or of AZFb plus AZFc. We studied three deletions of AZFb and eight deletions of AZFb plus AZFc, as assayed by the STSs defining these intervals. Guided by Y-chromosome sequence, we localized breakpoints precisely and were able to sequence nine of the deletion junctions. Homologous recombination can explain seven of these deletions but not the remaining two. This-fact and our discovery of breakpoint hotspots suggest that factors in addition to homology underlie these deletions. The deletions previously thought to define AZFb were found to extend from palindrome P5 to the proximal arm of palindrome PI, 1.5 Mb within AZFc. Thus, they do not define a genomic region separate from AZFc. We also found that the deletions of AZFb plus AZFc, as assayed by standard STSs heretofore available, in fact extend from P5 to the distal arm of P1 and spare distal AZFc. Both classes of deletions are massive: P5/proximal-P1 deletions encompass up to 6.2 Mb and remove 32 genes and transcripts; P5/distal-Pl deletions encompass up to 7.7 Mb and remove 42 genes and transcripts. To our knowledge, these are the largest of all human interstitial deletions for which deletion junctions and complete intervening sequence are available. The restriction of the associated phenotype to spermatogenic failure indicates the remarkable functional specialization of the affected regions of the Y chromosome. \textcopyright{} 2002 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

The DNA base-pair-step geometry has, overall, twice the curvature necessary to accommodate the DNA superhelical path in the nucleosome. DNA segments bent into the minor groove are either kinked or alternately shifted. The unusual DNA conformational parameters induced by the binding of histone protein have implications for sequence-dependent protein recognition and nucleosome positioning and mobility. Comparison of the 147-base-pair structure with two 146-base-pair structures reveals alterations in DNA twist that are evidently common in bulk chromatin, and which are of probable importance for chromatin fibre formation and chromatin remodelling.}

The function of Gurken signalling in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis later in oogenesis is better understood. Anteroior-posterior patterning of the embryo requires activities of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, localised within the oocyte.

  abstract = {Building a new organism usually requires the contribution of two differently shaped haploid cells, the male and female gametes, each providing its genetic material to restore diploidy of the new born zygote. The successful execution of this process requires defined sequential steps that must be completed in space and time. Otherwise, development fails. Relevant among the earlier steps are pronuclear migration and formation of the first mitotic spindle that promote the mixing of parental chromosomes and the formation of the zygotic nucleus. A complex microtubule network ensures the proper execution of these processes. Instrumental to microtubule organization and bipolar spindle assembly is a distinct non-membranous organelle, the centrosome. Centrosome inheritance during fertilization is biparental, since both gametes provide essential components to build a functional centrosome. This model does not explain, however, centrosome formation during parthenogenetic development, a special mode of sexual reproduction in which the unfertilized egg develops without the contribution of the male gamete. Moreover, whereas fertilization is a relevant example in which the cells actively check the presence of only one centrosome, to avoid multipolar spindle formation, the development of parthenogenetic eggs is ensured, at least in insects, by the de novo assembly of multiple centrosomes.Here, we will focus our attention on the assembly of functional centrosomes following fertilization and during parthenogenetic development in insects. Parthenogenetic development in which unfertilized eggs are naturally depleted of centrosomes would provide a useful experimental system to investigate centriole assembly and duplication together with centrosome formation and maturation.},

Ring canal assembly is a step-wise process that transforms an arrested cleavage furrow into a stable intercellular bridge by the addition of several proteins. Here we describe a new gene we named cheerio that provides a critical function for ring canal assembly. Mutants in cheerio fail to localize ring canal inner rim proteins including filamentous actin, the ring canal-associated products from the hu-li tai shao (hts) gene, and kelch. Since hts and kelch are present but unlocalized in cheerio mutant cells, cheerio is likely to function upstream from each of them. Examination of mutants in cheerio places it in the pathway of ring canal assembly between cleavage furrow arrest and localization of hts and actin filaments. Furthermore, this mutant reveals that the inner rim cytoskeleton is required for expansion of the ring canal opening and for plasma membrane stabilization.},

Accumulation of filamentous actin on ring canals coincides with the appearance of the hts protein. kelch, which is localized to the ring canals hours after hts and actin, is necessary for maintaining a highly ordered ring canal rim since kelch mutant egg chambers have ring canals that are obstructed by disordered actin and hts. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies immunostain ring canals beginning early in the germarium before hts and actin and throughout egg chamber development. The use of antibody reagents to analyze the structure of wild-type and mutant ring canals has shown that ring canal development is a dynamic process of cytoskeletal protein assembly, possibly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of some ring canal components.},

To achieve germline expression, it was critical to change the basal promoter and 3'-UTR in the Gal4-responsive expression vector (generating UASp). Basal promoters and heterologous 3'-UTRs are often considered neutral, but as shown here, can endow qualitative tissue-specificity to a chimeric transcript. The modified Ga14 system was used to investigate the role of the Drosophila FGF homologue branchless, ligand for the FGF receptor breathless, in border cell migration. FGF signaling guides tracheal cell migration in the embryo. However, misexpression of branchless in the ovary had no effect on border cell migration. Thus border cells and tracheal cells appear to be guided differently.},

These transitions are coordinated by the dynamic phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNAPII (Rpb1). The CTD is composed of reiterated heptapeptide repeats (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) that undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as RNAPII transitions through the transcription cycle. An essential phosphatase in this process is Ssu72, which exhibits catalytic specificity for Ser(P)5 and Ser(P)7. Ssu72 is unique in that it is specific for Ser(P)5 in one orientation of the CTD and for Ser(P)7 when bound in the opposite orientation. Moreover, Ssu72 interacts with components of the initiation machinery and affects start site selection yet is an integral component of the CPF 3{${'}$}-end-processing complex. Here we provide a comprehensive view of the effects of Ssu72 with respect to its Ser(P)5 phosphatase activity.Wedemonstrate that Ssu72 dephosphorylates Ser(P)5 at the initiation-elongation transition. Furthermore, Ssu72 indirectly affects the levels of Ser(P)2 during the elongation stage of transcription but does so independent of its catalytic activity.}

In this review, I will summarize available data about the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the control of Kit expression in the germline. Variable mechanisms, involving different germ cell-specific transcription factors, are operating in the various developmental stages: SOX2 and SOHLH1/2 act as direct positive regulators in PGCs and in postnatal spermatogonia, respectively, whereas PLZF sup-presses KIT expression in spermatogonial stem cells. DMRT1, acting through indirect mechanisms, suppresses KIT transcription in fetal gonocytes, while activating it in differentiating spermatogonia. \textcopyright{} 2013 UBC Press.},

  abstract = {The orthogonal axes of Drosophila are established during oogenesis through a hierarchical series of symmetry-breaking steps, most of which can be traced back to asymmetries inherent in the architecture of the ovary. Oogenesis begins with the formation of a germline cyst of 16 cells connected by ring canals. Two of these 16 cells have four ring canals, whereas the others have fewer. The first symmetry-breaking step is the selection of one of these two cells to become the oocyte. Subsequently, the germline cyst becomes surrounded by somatic follicle cells to generate individual egg chambers. The second symmetry-breaking step is the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the egg chamber, a process mediated by adhesive interactions with a special group of somatic cells. Posterior oocyte positioning is accompanied by a par gene-dependent repolarization of the microtubule network, which establishes the posterior cortex of the oocyte. The next two steps of symmetry breaking occur during midoogenesis after the volume of the oocyte has increased about 10-fold. First, a signal from the oocyte specifies posterior follicle cells, polarizing a symmetric prepattern present within the follicular epithelium. Second, the posterior follicle cells send a signal back to the oocyte, which leads to a second repolarization of the oocyte microtubule network and the asymmetric migration of the oocyte nucleus. This process again requires the par genes. The repolarization of the microtubule network results in the transport of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, the anterior and posterior determinants, respectively, of the embryonic axis, to opposite poles of the oocyte. The asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus defines a cortical region of the oocyte where gurken mRNA is localized, thus breaking the dorsal-ventral symmetry of the egg and embryo.},

  abstract = {Most ribosomal proteins (RPs) are stoichiometrically incorporated into ribosomal subunits and play essential roles in ribosome biogenesis and function. However, a number of RPs appear to have non-ribosomal functions, which involve direct association with pre-mRNA and transcription factors at transcription sites. The consensus is that the RPs found at these sites are off ribosomal subunits, but observation that different RPs are usually found together suggests that ribosomal or ribosomal-like subunits might be present. Notably, it has previously been reported that antibodies against 20 different RPs stain the same Pol II transcription sites in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. Some concerns, however, were raised about the specificity of the antibodies. To investigate further whether RPs are present at transcription sites in Drosophila, we have generated several transgenic flies expressing RPs (RpS2, RpS5a, RpS9, RpS11, RpS13, RpS18, RpL8, RpL11, RpL32, and RpL36) tagged with either green or red fluorescent protein. Imaging of salivary gland cells showed that these proteins are, as expected, abundant in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleolus. However, these RPs are also apparent in the nucleus in the region occupied by the chromosomes. Indeed, polytene chromosome immunostaining of a representative subset of tagged RPs confirms the association with transcribed loci. Furthermore, characterization of a strain expressing RpL41 functionally tagged at its native genomic locus with YFP, also showed apparent nuclear accumulation and chromosomal association, suggesting that such a nuclear localization pattern might be a shared feature of RPs and is biologically important.We anticipate that the transgenes described here should provide a useful research tool to visualize ribosomal subunits in Drosophila tissues and to study the non-ribosomal functions of RPs. \textcopyright{} 2013 Rugjee et al.},

Several chromatin modifiers have been identified as stemness factors in mammalian pluripotent stem cells, but whether these factors control stem cell polarity and asymmetric division has not been investigated so far. We addressed this question in Drosophila neural stem cells called neuroblasts. We identified the Tip60 chromatin remodeling complex and its interaction partner Myc as regulators of genes required for neuroblast maintenance. Knockdown of Tip60 complex members results in loss of cortical polarity, symmetric neuroblast division, and premature differentiation through nuclear entry of the transcription factor Prospero. We found that aPKC is the key target gene of Myc and the Tip60 complex subunit Domino in regulating neuroblast polarity. Our transcriptome analysis further showed that Domino regulates the expression of mitotic spindle genes previously identified as direct Myc targets. Our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved functional link between Myc, the Tip60 complex, and the molecular network controlling cell polarity and asymmetric cell division.}

The second PHD finger of human BPTF is known to specifically recognize histone H3 when methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3).

Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentified for a PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a unique trans-histone modification pattern that unambiguously resides within a single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these marks in the genome.

Here, we test the hypothesis that aging results in uncorrected defects in stem cell and/or niche function, which lead to system failure. We used the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation assay to determine the effect of aging on testis stem cell/niche function in mice. Between 12 and 24 months of age, male mice experienced a declining level of fertility associated with decreased testis weight, level of spermatogenesis, and total stem cell content. However, when stem cells were consecutively passaged at 3-month intervals to testes of young males, these stem cells continued to produce spermatogenesis for more than 3 years. Thus, SSC self-renewal continues long past the normal life span of the animal when the stem cell is continually maintained in a young niche/microenvironment. Moreover, these data suggest that infertility in old males results from deterioration of the SSC niche and failure to support an appropriate balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.},

Common traits of the Minute phenotype are short and thin bristles, slow development, and recessive lethality. By mobilizing a P-element inserted in the 5' UTR of M(3)95A, the gene encoding ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), we have generated two homozygous viable heteroalleles that are partial revertants with respect to tile Minute phenotype. Molecular characterization revealed both alleles to be imprecise excisions, leaving 40 and 110 bp, respectively, at the P-element insertion site. The weaker allele (40 bp insert) is associated with a {$\sim$}15\% decrease in RPS3 mRNA abundance and displays a moderate Minute phenotype. In the stronger allele (110 bp insert) RPS3 mRNA levels are reduced by {$\sim$}60\%, resulting in an extreme Minute phenotype that includes many morphological abnormalities as well as sterility in both males and females due to disruption of early gametogenesis. The results show that there is a correlation between reduced RPS3 mRNA levels and the severity of the Minute phenotype, in which faulty differentiation of somatic tissues and arrest of gametogenesis represent the extreme case. That heteroalleles in M(3)95A can mimic the phenotypic variations that exist between different Minute/rp-gene mutations strongly suggests that all phenotypes primarily are caused by reductions in maximum protein synthesis rates, but that the sensitivity for reduced levels of the individual rp-gene products is different.},

Trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) is preferentially detected at active genes, and is proposed to promote gene expression through recognition by transcription-activating effector molecules. Here we identify a novel class of methylated H3K4 effector domains\textendash the PHD domains of the ING (for inhibitor of growth) family of tumour suppressor proteins. The ING PHD domains are specific and highly robust binding modules for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. ING2, a native subunit of a repressive mSin3a-HDAC1 histone deacetylase complex, binds with high affinity to the trimethylated species. In response to DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by the ING2 PHD domain stabilizes the mSin3a-HDAC1 complex at the promoters of proliferation genes. This pathway constitutes a new mechanism by which H3K4me3 functions in active gene repression. Furthermore, ING2 modulates cellular responses to genotoxic insults, and these functions are critically dependent on ING2 interaction with H3K4me3. Together, our findings establish a pivotal role for trimethylation of H3K4 in gene repression and, potentially, tumour suppressor mechanisms.},

Low-resolution structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex indicated how TFIIB functions in DNA recruitment, but they lacked nucleic acids and half of the B-reader, leaving other TFIIB functions enigmatic. Here we report crystal structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 3.4 \textbackslash AA resolution and of an initially transcribing complex that additionally contains the DNA template and a 6-nucleotide RNA product. The structures reveal the entire B-reader and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and together with functional data lead to a more complete understanding of transcription initiation. TFIIB partially closes the polymerase cleft to position DNA and assist in its opening. The B-reader does not reach the active site but binds the DNA template strand upstream to assist in the recognition of the initiator sequence and in positioning the transcription start site. TFIIB rearranges active-site residues, induces binding of the catalytic metal ion B, and stimulates initial RNA synthesis allosterically. TFIIB then prevents the emerging DNA-RNA hybrid duplex from tilting, which would impair RNA synthesis. When the RNA grows beyond 6 nucleotides, it is separated from DNA and is directed to its exit tunnel by the B-reader loop. Once the RNA grows to 12-13 nucleotides, it clashes with TFIIB, triggering TFIIB displacement and elongation complex formation. Similar mechanisms may underlie all cellular transcription because all eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerases use TFIIB-like factors, and the bacterial initiation factor sigma has TFIIB-like topology and contains the loop region 3.2 that resembles the B-reader loop in location, charge and function. TFIIB and its counterparts may thus account for the two fundamental properties that distinguish RNA from DNA polymerases: primer-independent chain initiation and product separation from the template. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Moreover, a signaling and transcriptional principle governing these processes has been identified, raising the possibility of inducing the germ cell fate precisely from pluripotent stem cells in culture. These advances will in turn serve as a basis to explore the mechanism of germ cell specification in other mammals, including humans.

In flies, this is achieved by transcriptional upregulation of X chromosomal genes in males to equalize the gene dosage differences in females. Chromatin-bound proteins and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) constituting a ribonucleoprotein complex known as the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex or the dosage compensation complex mediate this process. MSL complex members decorate the male X chromosome, and their absence leads to male lethality. The male X chromosome is also enriched with histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac), indicating that the chromatin compaction status of the X chromosome also plays an important role in transcriptional activation. How the X chromosome is specifically targeted and how dosage compensation is mechanistically achieved are central questions for the field.

Oogonia, which originate from primordial germ cells, proliferate by mitosis and form primary oocytes that arrest at the prophase stage of the first meiotic division until they are fully-grown. Within primary oocytes, synthesis and accumulation of RNAs and proteins throughout oogenesis are essential for oocyte growth and maturation; and moreover, crucial for developing into a viable embryo after fertilization. Oocyte meiotic and developmental competence is gained in a gradual and sequential manner during folliculogenesis and is related to the fact that the oocyte grows in interaction with its companion somatic cells. Communication between oocyte and its surrounding granulosa cells is vital, both for oocyte development and for granulosa cells differentiation. Oocytes depend on differentiated cumulus cells, which provide them with nutrients and regulatory signals needed to promote oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and consequently the acquisition of developmental competence. The purpose of this article is to summarize recent knowledge on the molecular aspects of oogenesis and oocyte maturation, and the crucial role of cumulus-cell interactions, highlighting the valuable contribution of experimental evidences obtained in animal models.

When short half-life mRNA genes are studied (e.g. c-fos and egr1), RNAPol-ChIP gives results similar to those of other procedures. However, in genes whose mRNA is more stable (e.g. the hemopexin, hpx, gene) RNAPol-ChIP informs on real-time transcription with results comparable to those of methods such as nuclear run-on or run-off, which require the isolation of highly purified nuclei. Moreover, RNAPol-ChIP advantageously compares with methods based on the analysis of steady-state mRNA (northern blot or RT\textendash PCR).

It is therefore the presence of a trimethylated K4 that defines an active state of gene expression.

  abstract = {Induction of gene expression in yeast and human cells involves changes in the histone modifications associated with promoters. Here we identify a histone H3 endopeptidase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that may regulate these events. The endopeptidase cleaves H3 after Ala21, generating a histone that lacks the first 21 residues and shows a preference for H3 tails carrying repressive modifications. In vivo, the H3 N terminus is clipped, specifically within the promoters of genes following the induction of transcription. H3 clipping precedes the process of histone eviction seen when genes become fully active. A truncated H3 product is not generated in yeast carrying a mutation of the endopeptidase recognition site (H3 Q19A L20A) and gene induction is defective in these cells. These findings identify clipping of H3 tails as a previously uncharacterized modification of promoter-bound nucleosomes, which may result in the localized clearing of repressive signals during the induction of gene expression. \textcopyright{} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

We find that P/CAF is acetylated by itself and by p300 but not by CBP. P/CAF acetylation can be an intra- or intermolecular event. The intermolecular acetylation requires the N-terminal domain of P/CAF. The intramolecular acetylation targets five lysines (416-442) at the P/CAF C-terminus, which are in the nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Finally, we show that acetylation of P/CAF leads to an increment of its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. These findings identify a new post-translation modification on P/CAF which may regulate its function.}

N-epsilon acetylation of lysine residues was initially discovered on histones and has been studied extensively in the context of chromatin and DNA metabolism, such as transcription, replication and repair. However, recent research shows that acetylation is more widespread than initially thought and that it regulates various nuclear as well as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial processes. In this review, we present the multitude of non-histone proteins targeted by lysine acetyltransferases of the large and conserved MYST family, and known functional consequences of this acetylation. Substrates of MYST enzymes include factors involved in transcription, heterochromatin formation and cell cycle, DNA repair proteins, gluconeogenesis enzymes and finally subunits of MYST protein complexes themselves. Discovering novel substrates of MYST proteins is pivotal for the understanding of the diverse functions of these essential acetyltransferases in nuclear processes, signaling, stress response and metabolism. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer Basel AG.},

Nuclear pores are therefore involved in repressing, as well as activating, transcription.

Trimethylation requires histone H2B ubiquitylation and the PAF1 complex, which are linked to transcription elongation, but how they activate Set1 is not known. Set1 also bears several conserved domains with uncharacterized contributions to activity. Here, we isolated dominant hyperactive SET1D alleles, which revealed a complex interplay among Set1 regulatory domains. Remarkably, the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of Set1 is required for H3K4 trimethylation, but not dimethylation. Also, a central autoinhibitory domain was identified that opposes RRM function by inhibiting trimethylation. Furthermore, a G990E replacement in the catalytic domain conferred Set1 hyperactivity and restored trimethylation to a Set1 derivative bearing mutations in the RRM domain. Surprisingly, certain SET1D alleles also partially restored trimethylation to strains lacking histone H2B ubiquitylation or Paf1. Taken together, our data suggest that the catalytic domain of Set1 integrates opposing inputs from the RRM and autoinhibitory domains to link properly H3K4 methylation to the transcript elongation process. \textcopyright{} 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

The molecular mechanisms involved in this process are incompletely understood. Here, we propose that the SFiNX complex, a silencing mediator downstream of nuclear Piwi-piRNA complexes in Drosophila, enables co-transcriptional silencing via the formation of molecular condensates. Condensate formation is stimulated by nucleic acid binding and requires SFiNX dimerization, mediated by the dynein light chain protein, LC8/Cutup. LC8's function within SFiNX can be bypassed with a heterologous dimerization domain, suggesting that dimerization is a constitutive feature of SFiNX. Mutations preventing LC8mediated SFiNX dimerization result in loss of condensate formation in vitro and inability of Piwi to initiate heterochromatin formation and silence transposons in vivo. Formation of molecular condensates might be a general mechanism that underlies effective heterochromatin establishment at small RNA target loci in a co-transcriptional manner.},

We found that LTM, isomigrastatin and analogs have a potent antiproliferative effect on tumor cell lines and selectively inhibit translation. A systematic comparative study of the effects of CHX and LTM on protein synthesis revealed both similarities and differences between the two inhibitors. Both LTM and CHX were found to block the translocation step in elongation. Footprinting experiments revealed protection of a single cytidine nucleotide (C3993) in the E-site of the 60S ribosomal subunit, thus defining a common binding pocket for the two inhibitors in the ribosome.

Previous work has demonstrated a role for mammalian VRK1 in proliferation of male spermatogonia, yet whether VRK1 plays a role in meiotic progression, as seen in Drosophila, has not been determined. Here, we have established a mouse strain bearing a gene trap insertion in the VRK1 locus that disrupts Vrk1 expression. In addition to the male proliferation defects, we find that reduction of VRK1 activity causes a delay in meiotic progression during oogenesis, results in the presence of lagging chromosomes during formation of the metaphase plate, and ultimately leads to the failure of oocytes to be fertilized. The activity of at least one phosphorylation substrate of VRK1, p53, is not required for these defects. These results are consistent with previously defined functions of VRK1 in meiotic progression in Drosophila oogenesis, and indicate a conserved role for VRK1 in coordinating proper chromosomal configuration in female meiosis. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Using the vitamin A-deficient mouse model, we studied messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in undifferentiated and differentiating type A spermatogonia. Furthermore, we quantified the immuno-positive type A spermatogonia in the epithelial stages VI, VII, IX/X, and XII in normal mice to correlate c-kit expression in type A spermatogonia with the differentiation of these cells. Our results show that in the VAD situation undifferentiated type A spermatogonia express little c-kit mRNA. The A spermatogonia with a larger nucleus expressed c-Kit protein, whereas the A spermatogonia with a smaller one did not. After induction of differentiation of these cells into type A1 spermatogonia, c-kit mRNA was enhanced. The percentage of A spermatogonia expressing c-Kit protein did not change during this process, suggesting that A spermatogonia, which are committed to differentiate express c-kit. Under normal circumstances in epithelial stage VI 16\% {$\pm$} 2\% (mean {$\pm$} sd), in VII 45\% {$\pm$} 15\%, in IX/X 78\% {$\pm$} 14\% and in XII 90\% {$\pm$} 1.9\% of the type A spermatogonia were c-kit positive, suggesting that Aaligned spermatogonia gradually change from c-Kit negative to c-Kit positive cells before their differentiation into A1 spermatogonia.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies link H3-lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation to HP1-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. However, the mechanisms that target and coordinate these activities to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we report that the KAP-1 corepressor for the KRAB-ZFP superfamily of transcriptional silencers binds to SETDB1, a novel SET domain protein with histone H3-K9-specific methyltransferase activity. Although acetylation and phosphorylation of the H3 N-terminal tail profoundly affect the efficiency of H3-K9 methylation by SETDB1, we found that methylation of H3-K4 does not affect SETDB1-mediated methylation of H3-K9. In vitro methylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 by SETDB1 is sufficient to enhance the binding of HP1 proteins, which requires both an intact chromodomain and chromoshadow domain. Indirect immunofluoresence staining of interphase nuclei localized SETDB1 predominantly in euchromatic regions that overlap with HP1 staining in nonpericentromeric regions of chromatin. Moreover, KAP-1, SETDB1, H3-MeK9, and HP1 are enriched at promoter sequences of a euchromatic gene silenced by the KRAB\textendash KAP-1 repression system. Thus, KAP-1 is a molecular scaffold that is targeted by KRAB-ZFPs to specific loci and coordinates both histone methylation and the deposition of HP1 proteins to silence gene expression.},

  abstract = {Mutations in seven different maternal-effect loci on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster all cause alterations in the anterior-posterior pattern of the embryo. Mutations in torso (tor) and trunk (trk) delete the anterior- and posterior-most structures of the embryo. At the same time they shift cellular fates which are normally found in the subterminal regions of the embryo towards the poles. Mutations in vasa (vas), valois (vls), staufen (stau) and tudor (tud) cause two embryonic defects. For one they result in absence of polar plasm, polar granules and pole cells in all eggs produced by mutant females. Secondly, embryos developing inside such eggs show deletions of abdominal segments. In addition, embryos derived from staufen mothers lack anterior head structures, embryos derived from valois mothers frequently fail to cellularize properly. Mutations in exuperantia (exu) cause deletions of anterior head structures, similar to torso, trunk and staufen. However in exu, these head structures are replaced by an inverted posterior end which comprises posterior midgut, proctodeal region, and often malpighian tubules.The effects of all mutations can be traced back to the beginning stages of gastrulation, indicating that the alterations in cellular fates have probably taken place by that time. Analysis of embryos derived from double mutant mothers suggests that these three phenotypic groups of mutants interfere with three different, independent pathways. All three pathways seem to act additively on the system which specifies anterior-posterior cellular fates within the egg.},

Here we will consider general features of the architectural organization of the Drosophila genome, providing historical perspective and insights from recent work. We will compare the linear and spatial segmentation of the fly genome and focus on the two key regulators of genome architecture: insulator components and Polycomb group proteins. With its unique set of genetic tools and a compact, well annotated genome, Drosophila is poised to remain a model system of choice for rapid progress in understanding principles of genome organization and to serve as a proving ground for development of 3D genome-engineering techniques.},

Five proteins, collectively called the MSLs, are required for dosage compensation and male viability. Here we show that one of these proteins, MSL1, interacts with three others, MSL2, MSL3 and MOF. The latter is a putative histone acetyl transferase. Overexpression of either the N- or C-terminal domain of MSL1 has dominant-negative effects, i.e. causes male-specific lethality. The lethality due to expression of the N-terminal domain is reduced if msl2 is co-overexpressed. MSL2 co-purifies over a FLAG affinity column with the tagged region of MSL1, and both MSL3 and MOF co-purify with the FLAG-tagged MSL1 C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the MSL1 C-terminal domain binds specifically to a GST-MOF fusion protein and co-immunoprecipitates with HA-tagged MSL3. The MSL1 C-terminal domain shows similarity to a region of mouse CBP, a transcription co-activator. We conclude that a main role of MSL1 is to serve as the backbone for assembly of the MSL complex.},

While many direct Myc target genes have been identified, the molecular determinants of Myc's transcriptional specificity remain elusive. We have carried out a genetic screen in Drosophila and identified the Trithorax group protein Little imaginal discs (Lid) as a regulator of dMyc-induced cell growth. Lid binds to dMyc and is required for dMyc-induced expression of the growth regulatory gene Nop60B. The mammalian Lid orthologs, Rbp-2 (JARID1A) and Plu-1 (JARID1B), also bind to c-Myc, indicating that Lid-Myc function is conserved. We demonstrate that Lid is a JmjC-dependent trimethyl H3K4 demethylase in vivo and that this enzymatic activity is negatively regulated by dMyc, which binds to Lid's JmjC domain. Because Myc binding is associated with high levels of trimethylated H3K4, we propose that the Lid-dMyc complex facilitates Myc binding to, or maintenance of, this chromatin context. \textcopyright{} 2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular DNA sequences, reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to DNA. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome-DNA interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain {$\sim$}50\% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation, and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

However, individual paralogs can confer vastly different effects upon cellular processes, e.g., specific yeast paralogs regulate actin organization, bud site selection, and mRNA localization, although how specificity is conferred is unknown. Changes in the RP composition of ribosomes might allow for specialized translation of different subsets of mRNAs, yet it is unclear whether specialized ribosomes exist and if paralog specificity controls translation. Using translatome analyses, we show that the translation of mitochondrial proteins is highly down-regulated in yeast lacking RP paralogs required for normal mitochondrial function (e.g., RPL1b). Although RPL1a and RPL1b encode identical proteins, Rpl1b-containing ribosomes confer more efficient translation of respiration-related proteins. Thus, ribosomes varying in RP composition may confer specialized functions, and RP paralog specificity defines a novel means of translational control.}

We report here the genetic characterization and cloning of Mothers against dpp (Mad), a gent identified in two such screens. Mad loss-of-function mutations interact with dpp alleles to enhance embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning defects, as well as adult appendage defects, suggesting a role for Mad in mediating some aspect of dpp function. In support of this, homozygous Mad mutant animals exhibit defects in midgut morphogenesis, imaginal disk development and embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning that are very reminiscent of dpp mutant phenotypes. We cloned the Mad region and identified the Mad transcription unit through germline transformation rescue. We sequenced a Mad cDNA and identified three Mad point mutations that alter the coding information. The predicted MAD polypeptide lacks known protein motifs, but has strong sequence similarity to three polypeptides predicted from genomic sequence from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Hence, MAD is a member of a novel, highly conserved protein family.},

In many organisms, repetitive DNA is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin that is marked by di/trimethylation of histone H3K9 and the associated protein HP1a. These modifications enforce the unique epigenetic properties of heterochromatin. However, in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, the heterochromatin lacks these modifications, which appear only later, when rapid embryonic cell cycles slow down at the midblastula transition (MBT). Here we focus on the initial steps restoring heterochromatic modifications in the embryo. We describe the JabbaTrap, a technique for inactivating maternally provided proteins in embryos. Using the JabbaTrap, we reveal a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin. In contrast, other methyltransferases contribute minimally. Live imaging reveals that endogenous Eggless gradually accumulates on chromatin in interphase but then dissociates in mitosis, and its accumulation must restart in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle slowing as the embryo approaches the MBT permits increasing accumulation and action of Eggless at its targets. Experimental manipulation of interphase duration shows that cell cycle speed regulates Eggless. We propose that developmental slowing of the cell cycle times embryonic heterochromatin formation.},

Here, we show that DmSETDB1 is involved in nonpericentric H3K9 methylation. Analysis of two DmSetdb1 alleles generated by homologous recombination, a deletion, and an allele where the 3HA tag is fused to the endogenous DmSetdb1, reveals that this gene is essential for fly viability and that DmSETDB1 localizes mainly at Chromosome 4. It also shows that DmSETDB1 is responsible for some of the H3K9 mono- and dimethyl marks in euchromatin and for H3K9 dimethylation on Chromosome 4. Moreover, DmSETDB1 is required for variegated repression of transgenes inserted on Chromosome 4. This study defines DmSETDB1 as a H3K9 methyltransferase that specifically targets euchromatin and the autosomal Chromosome 4 and shows that it is an essential factor for Chromosome 4 silencing.},

Here, we systematically tested the function of all 13 Drosophila JmjC genes. Generation of molecularly defined null mutants revealed that loss of 8 out of 13 JmjC genes modify position effect variegation (PEV) phenotypes, consistent with their ascribed role in regulating chromatin organization. However, most JmjC genes do not critically regulate development, as 10 members are viable and fertile with no obvious developmental defects. Rather, we find that different JmjC mutants specifically alter the phenotypic outcomes in various sensitized genetic backgrounds. Our data demonstrate that, rather than controlling essential gene expression programs, Drosophila JmjC proteins generally act to "fine-tune" different biological processes.}

In Drosophila females, germline stem cells (GSCs) require Sex lethal (Sxl) to exit the stem cell state and to enter the differentiation pathway. Without Sxl GSCs do not differentiate and instead form tumors. Previous studies have shown that these tumors are not caused by a failure in the self-renewal/differentiation switch. Here, we show that Sxl is also necessary for the cell-autonomous maintenance of germ cell female identity and demonstrate that tumors are caused by the acquisition of male characteristics. Germ cells without Sxl protein exhibit a global derepression of testis genes, including Phf7, a male germline sexual identity gene. Phf7 is a key effector of the tumor-forming pathway, as it is both necessary and sufficient for tumor formation. In the absence of Sxl protein, inappropriate Phf7 expression drives tumor formation through a cell-autonomous mechanism that includes sex-inappropriate activation of Jak/Stat signaling. Remarkably, tumor formation requires a novel response to external signals emanating from the GSC niche, highlighting the importance of interactions between mutant cells and the surrounding normal cells that make up the tumor microenvironment. Derepression of testis genes, and inappropriate Phf7 expression, is also observed in germ cell tumors arising from the loss of bag of marbles (bam), demonstrating that maintenance of female sexual identity requires the concerted actions of Sxl and bam. Our work reveals that GSCs must maintain their sexual identity as they are reprogrammed into a differentiated cell, or risk tumorigenesis., Summary: The concerted actions of Sxl and bam allow Drosophila female germline stem cells to remember their sexual identity as they differentiate, thereby preventing the risk of tumor formation.},

Moreover, the objective is to provide an update on the state of the art concerning the potential use of human spermatogonia for clinical applications. Germ cell specification mechanisms and epigenetic as well as transcriptional features of primordial germ cells (PGC) and adult spermatogonia at the single-cell level are reviewed. Studies on single-cell analyses have been included as they provide hitherto unequaled resolution of the transcriptional profiles of unselected human testicular cells and, thereby, new insights into the molecular aspects of germ cell differentiation. Datasets on models of spermatogonial expansion were identified and spermatogonial turnover and lifetime sperm production rates in various species were calculated, based exclusively on studies employing the optical dissector approach. Finally, the state of the art concerning causes of impaired spermatogonial function and fertility preservation were comprehensively reviewed. RNA sequencing data from PGC and spermatogonia indicate that transcriptional heterogeneity is a feature of germ cells prior to differentiation. Based on these data as well as lineage-tracing studies it is now debated whether spermatogonia are a rather plastic population of undifferentiated germ cells with the stem cell niche being the regulatory unit for cell fate decisions. Based on our novel calculations we suggest that spermatogonia are adapted to the individual reproductive lifespan and that the life-long sperm output from a spermatogonium is balanced against the duration of a generation. Thereby, the risk of jeopardizing genome integrity is balanced against a maximized sperm output. With reference to Yves Clermont's statement, and based on recent datasets, we suggest that the question that needs to be answered is: 'Is there a true stem cell?' or better 'Is there a population of various cells with distinct features serving as a stem cell pool?'. This review provides an update including novel views on various aspects of spermatogonial biology (from embryonic to adult stages).

The differentiation factor BAM is necessary and sufficient for GSC differentiation, but it still remains expressed in GSCs at low levels. However, it is unclear how its function is repressed in GSCs to maintain self-renewal. Here, we report the identification of the translation initiation factor eIF4A for its essential role in self-renewal by directly inactivating BAM function. eIF4A can physically interact with BAM in Drosophila S2 cells and yeast cells. eIF4A exhibits dosage-specific interactions with bam in the regulation of GSC differentiation. It is required intrinsically for controlling GSC self-renewal and proliferation but not survival. In addition, it is required for maintaining E-cadherin expression but not BMP signaling activity. Furthermore, BAM and BGCN together repress translation of Ecadherin through its 3{${'}$} UTR in S2 cells. Therefore, we propose that BAM functions as a translation repressor by interfering with translation initiation and eIF4A maintains self-renewal by inhibiting BAM function and promoting E-cadherin expression.},

In order to fluorescently mark pole cells, we used an EGFP-vasa transgenic line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) specifically and continuously in the germ line throughout the life cycle. The purity of FACS-sorted pole cells from embryos was confirmed by microscopic inspection and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

To explore the genetic regulation of the germ-line development, we initiated a comprehensive identification and functional analysis of the genes expressed within the EGs. First, we generated a cDNA library from gonads purified from Drosophila embryos by FACS. Using this library, we catalogued the genes expressed in the gonad by EST analysis. A total of 17,218 high-quality ESTs representing 3,051 genes were obtained, corresponding to 20\% of the predicted genes in the genome. The EG transcriptome is unexpectedly distinct from that of adult gonads and includes an extremely high proportion of retrotransposon-derived transcripts. We verified 101 genes preferentially expressed in the EGs by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Within this subset, 39 and 58 genes were expressed predominantly in germ-line and somatic cells, respectively, whereas four genes were expressed in the both cell lineages. The gonad-enriched genes encompassed a variety of predicted functions. However, genes implicated in SUMOylation and protein translation, including germ-line-specific ribosomal proteins, are preferentially expressed in the germ line, whereas the expression of various retrotransposons and RNAi-related genes are more prominent in the gonadal soma.

However, an outstanding question is whether ribosome heterogeneity at the level of core ribosomal proteins (RPs) exists and enables ribosomes to preferentially translate specific mRNAs genome-wide. Here, we measured the absolute abundance of RPs in translating ribosomes and profiled transcripts that are enriched or depleted from select subsets of ribosomes within embryonic stem cells. We find that heterogeneity in RP composition endows ribosomes with differential selectivity for translating subpools of transcripts, including those controlling metabolism, cell cycle, and development. As an example, mRNAs enriched in binding to RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes are shown to require RPL10A/uL1 for their efficient translation. Within several of these transcripts, this level of regulation is mediated, at least in part, by internal ribosome entry sites. Together, these results reveal a critical functional link between ribosome heterogeneity and the post-transcriptional circuitry of gene expression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. There are currently few effective therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). CRPC which is resistant to castration is thought to result from increased activation of the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, which may be augmented by AR coactivators. METHODS. Luciferase reporter assay, Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence microscopy, cell proliferation assay, and flow cytometry for cell-cycle analysis were used to resolve a role of Tip60 regulating AR in PCa cells. RESULTS. Tip60 regulated transcriptions of AR target genes androgen independently. Tip60 knockdown induced translocation of AR into the cytoplasm. Acetylation-mimicking mutations in the nuclear localization signal sequence caused AR protein to mainly localize in the nucleus despite androgen starvation, whereas non-acetylation-mimicking mutations caused AR to mainly localize in the cytoplasm despite androgen stimulation. Tip60 overexpression in castration-resistant LNCaP derivative CxR cells resulted in increases in the acetylated form of AR and AR localization in the nucleus even without androgen. Consequently, Tip60 silencing suppressed the growth of AR-expressing PCa cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, similar to inhibition of androgen/AR signaling. Furthermore, Tip60 knockdown suppressed the cell growth of CxR cells. CONCLUSIONS. Tip60 is involved in the proliferation of PCa cells as an AR coactivator. Modulation of Tip60 expression or function may be a useful strategy for developing novel therapeutics for PCa, even CRPC, which remain dependent on AR signaling, by overexpressing AR and its coactivators. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The incorporation of this modified histone into nucleosomal arrays inhibits the formation of compact 30-nanometer-like fibers and impedes the ability of chromatin to form cross-fiber interactions. H4-K16Ac also inhibits the ability of the adenosine triphosphate-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling enzyme ACF to mobilize a mononucleosome, indicating that this single histone modification modulates both higher order chromatin structure and functional interactions between a nonhistone protein and the chromatin fiber.}

Genome-wide assays revealed highly correlated changes in RNA polymerase II recruitment, nascent RNA output, and steady-state RNA levels of transposons upon loss of Piwi or Maelstrom. Our data demonstrate piRNA-mediated trans-silencing of hundreds of transposon copies at the transcriptional level. We show that Piwi is required to establish heterochromatic H3K9me3 marks on transposons and their genomic surroundings. In contrast, loss of Maelstrom affects transposon H3K9me3 patterns only mildly yet leads to increased heterochromatin spreading, suggesting that Maelstrom acts downstream of or in parallel to H3K9me3. Our work illustrates the widespread influence of transposons and the piRNA pathway on chromatin patterns and gene expression.},

Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis.

By further characterizing RAPs, we discover the presence of ufmylation, a metazoan-specific post-translational modification (PTM), on ribosomes and define its direct substrates. Moreover, we show that the metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), interacts with sub-pools of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes, exerting a non-canonical function as an RNA-binding protein in the translation of ER-destined mRNAs. Therefore, RAPs interconnect one of life's most ancient molecular machines with diverse cellular processes, providing an additional layer of regulatory potential to protein expression.},

We show by affinity purification, immunoprecipitation analysis, and E. coli two-hybrid screening that L4 interacts with a site outside of the catalytic domain of RNase E to regulate the endoribonucleolytic functions of the enzyme, thus inhibiting RNase E-specific cleavage in vitro, stabilizing mRNAs targeted by RNase E in vivo, and controlling plasmid DNA replication by stabilizing an antisense regulatory RNA normally attacked by RNase E. Broader effects of the L4-RNase E interaction on E. coli transcripts were shown by DNA microarray analysis, which revealed changes in the abundance of 65 mRNAs encoding the stress response proteins HslO, Lon, CstA, YjiY, and YaeL, as well as proteins involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and transport, transcription/translation, and DNA/RNA synthesis. Analysis of mRNA stability showed that the half lives of stress-responsive transcripts were increased by ectopic expression of L4, which normally increases along with other r-proteins in E. coli under stress conditions, and also by inactivation of RNase E. Our finding that L4 can inhibit RNase E-dependent decay may account at least in part for the elevated production of stress-induced proteins during bacterial adaptation to adverse environments. \textcopyright{} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Results: These changes reflect epigenetic regulation. Induction of late spermatogenesis genes during spermatogenesis is facilitated by poised chromatin established in the stem cell phases of spermatogonia, whereas silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during meiosis and postmeiosis is associated with formation of bivalent domains which also allows the recovery of the somatic/progenitor program after fertilization. Importantly, during spermatogenesis mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on sex chromosomes are different from autosomes: X-linked somatic/progenitor genes are suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation without deposition of H3K27me3. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me2/3 domains are not limited to developmental promoters (which maintain bivalent domains that are silent throughout the reproductive cycle), but also underlie reversible silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in late spermatogenesis.},

From cells to purified DNA, CUT\&RUNrequires less than a day at the laboratory bench and requires no specialized skills.}

We have identified a 17 bp element that is sufficient for accurate basal transcription of this gene both in vitro and in vivo. This motif, the initiator (Inr), contains within itself the transcription start site. Homology to the Inr is found in many TATA-containing genes, and specific mutagenesis influences both the efficiency and accuracy of initiation. Moreover, in the presence of either a TATA box or the SV40 21 bp repeats, a greatly increased level of transcription initiates specifically at the Inr. Thus, the Inr constitutes the simplest functional promoter that has been identified and provides one explanation for how promoters that lack TATA elements direct transcription initiation. \textcopyright{} 1989.}

Entry into the spermatogenesis or oogenesis pathway requires that the appropriate gene network is activated and the antagonist network is silenced. For example, in Drosophila female germ cells, forced expression of the testis-specific PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) disrupts oogenesis, leading to either an agametic or germ cell tumor phenotype. Here, we show that PHF7-expressing ovarian germ cells inappropriately express hundreds of genes, many of which are male germline genes. We find that the majority of genes under PHF7 control in female germ cells are not under PHF7 control in male germ cells, suggesting that PHF7 is acting in a tissue-specific manner. Remarkably, transcriptional reprogramming includes a positive autoregulatory feedback mechanism in which ectopic PHF7 overcomes its own transcriptional repression through promoter switching. Furthermore, we find that tumorigenic capacity is dependent on the dosage of phf7. This study reveals that ectopic PHF7 in female germ cells leads to a loss of sexual identity and the promotion of a regulatory circuit that is beneficial for tumor initiation and progression.},

Germ cell specific loss of the H3K9me3 pathway members, the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, WDE, and HP1a, leads to ectopic expression of genes, many of which are normally expressed in testis. SETDB1 controls the accumulation of H3K9me3 over a subset of these genes without spreading into neighboring loci. At phf7, a regulator of male germ cell sexual fate, the H3K9me3 peak falls over the silenced testis-specific transcription start site. Furthermore, H3K9me3 recruitment to phf7 and repression of testis-specific transcription is dependent on the female sex determination gene Sxl. Thus, female identity is secured by an H3K9me3 epigenetic pathway in which Sxl is the upstream female-specific regulator, SETDB1 is the required chromatin writer, and phf7 is one of the critical SETDB1 target genes.},

  abstract = {Drosophila ovarian cysts arise through a series of four synchronous incomplete mitotic divisions. After each round of mitosis, a membranous organelle, the fusome, grows along the cleavage furrow and the remnants of the mitotic spindle to connect all cystocytes in a cyst. The fusome is essential for the pattern and synchrony of the mitotic cyst divisions as well as oocyte differentiation. Using live cell imaging, greenfluorescent protein-tagged proteins, and photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate that fusomal endomembranes are part of a single continuous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is shared by all cystocytes in dividing ovarian cysts. Membrane and lumenal proteins of the common ER freely and rapidly diffuse between cystocytes. The fusomal ER mediates intercellular ER connectivity by linking the cytoplasmic ER membranes of all cystocytes within a cyst. Before entry into meiosis and onset of oocyte differentiation (between region 1 and region 2A), ER continuity between cystocytes is lost. Furthermore, analyses of hts and Dhc64c mutants indicate that intercellular ER continuity within dividing ovarian cysts requires the fusome cytoskeletal component and suggest a possible role for the common ER in synchronizing mitotic cyst divisions.}

This methylation ``gradient'' is thought to result from preferential binding of the H3K4 methyltransferase Set1/complex associated with Set1 (COMPASS) to promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II. However, other studies have suggested that location-specific cues allosterically activate Set1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments show that H3K4 methylation patterns on active genes are not universal or fixed and change in response to both transcription elongation rate and frequency as well as reduced COMPASS activity. Fusing Set1 to RNA polymerase II results in H3K4me2 throughout transcribed regions and similarly extended H3K4me3 on highly transcribed genes. Tethered Set1 still requires histone H2B ubiquitylation for activity. These results show that higher-level methylations reflect not only Set1/COMPASS recruitment but also multiple rounds of transcription. This model provides a simple explanation for non-canonical methylation patterns at some loci or in certain COMPASS mutants. Soares et al. show that the H3K4 methylation gradient, an important chromatin modification at active genes, is determined not only by targeted recruitment of the Set1 methyltransferase but also by transcription frequency and elongation rate. Fusing Set1 to RNA polymerase results in extended H3K4 methylation throughout the gene.},

  abstract = {The chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, comprising events such as laying down of meiotic cohesins, synapsis between homologs, and homologous recombination, must be preceded and enabled by the regulated induction of meiotic prophase genes. This gene regulatory program is poorly understood, particularly in organisms with a segregated germline. We characterized the gene regulatory program of meiotic prophase as it occurs in the mouse fetal ovary. By profiling gene expression in the mouse fetal ovary in mutants with whole tissue and single-cell techniques, we identified 104 genes expressed specifically in pre-meiotic to pachytene germ cells. We characterized the regulation of these genes by 1) retinoic acid (RA), which induces meiosis, 2) Dazl, which is required for germ cell competence to respond to RA, and 3) Stra8, a downstream target of RA required for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase. Initial induction of practically all identified meiotic prophase genes requires Dazl. In the presence of Dazl, RA induces at least two pathways: one Stra8-independent, and one Stra8-dependent. Genes vary in their induction by Stra8, spanning fully Stra8-independent, partially Stra8-independent, and fully Stra8-dependent. Thus, Stra8 regulates the entirety of the chromosomal program but plays a more nuanced role in governing the gene expression program. We propose that Stra8-independent gene expression enables the stockpiling of selected meiotic structural proteins prior to the commencement of the chromosomal program. Unexpectedly, we discovered that Stra8 is required for prompt down-regulation of itself and Rec8. Germ cells that have expressed and down-regulated Stra8 are refractory to further Stra8 expression. Negative feedback of Stra8, and subsequent resistance to further Stra8 expression, may ensure a single, restricted pulse of Stra8 expression. Collectively, our findings reveal a gene regulatory logic by which germ cells prepare for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, and ensure that it is induced only once.}

The role of Nuclear Pore Proteins (Nups) in transcription and their involvement in leukemia and viral integration has renewed interest in understanding their mechanism of action. Nups bind to both repressed and active genes, often in a regulated fashion. Nups can associate with chromatin both at the NPC and inside the nucleoplasm. These interactions are guided by evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that involve promoter DNA elements and trans-acting factors. These interactions can also lead to interchromosomal clustering of co-regulated genes. Nups affect gene expression by promoting stronger transcription, by limiting the spread of repressed chromatin or by altering chromatin structure. Nups can promote epigenetic regulation by establishing boundary elements and poising recently repressed genes for faster reactivation.},

Many studies have generated individual measures of FD, but the profile of FD between paralogs across levels of phenotypic space remains largely uncharted. We evaluate paralog pairs that originated via the yeast whole-genome duplication (ohnolog pairs) at three distinct phenotypic levels (properties of proteins, gene expression, and overall organismal growth) using eight complementary measures of FD (protein: evolutionary rates, radical amino acid substitutions, and domain architecture; gene expression: expression differences in a single species and condition, across species in a single condition, and in a single species across conditions; and organismal: genetic interaction profiles and growth profiles in multiple conditions). We find that the majority of ohnolog pairs show FD by multiple phenotypic measures. Within each phenotypic level, measures of FD are strongly correlated but are generally weakly correlated between levels, suggesting that functional constraints exerted on genes from distinct phenotypic levels are largely decoupled. Our results suggest that redundancy is a rare functional fate for retained paralogs and that FD cannot be fully captured by measures at any single phenotypic level. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author.},

A major advantage is cellular simplicity. Each ovary is composed of 15 to 16 ovarioles: strings of progressively more mature egg chambers, tipped with a special region known as the germarium where the egg chambers originate (Fig. 1). The linear organization of ovarioles and their multiplicity ensure that all stages of oogenesis are readily available and easily recognized. Each egg chamber develops independently of its neighbors; cellular interactions involve only the constituent cells: a germ line cyst consisting of a single oocyte connected to 15 nurse cells via a system of intercellular bridges, and a surrounding monolayer of up to 650 somatic follicle cells (Fig. 1B). Egg chamber construction begins with germ line cyst formation in the anterior thirds...},

These transcription factors include tumor promoters and also tumor suppressors, such as p53, which links Tip60 to DNA damage responses. Tip60 also has transcription-independent roles in DNA damage responses. First, independently from NuA4, Tip60 binds the kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and participates in their activation by DNA double-strand breaks. Second, NuA4 is recruited to the chromatin surrounding the breaks and, through a series of chromatin modifications, contributes to the dynamics of DNA repair. These molecular activities might endow Tip60 with multiple and potentially antagonistic biological functions. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

We have determined the intron/exon structure of the trx gene and the large alternatively spliced trx RNAs, which are capable of encoding only two protein isoforms. These very large trx proteins differ only in a long Ser- and Gly-rich N-terminal extension, encoded by exon II, which is present only in the larger trx isoform. We have identified a novel variant of the highly conserved nuclear receptor type of DNA binding domain. We have found that the previously identified Cys-rich central region contains multiple novel zinc finger motifs which are also present in the Polycomb-like protein and RBP2, a retinoblastoma binding protein. The trx proteins terminate with another novel conserved domain which we have identified in proteins from three kingdoms, including plants and fungi, indicating that has an ancient origin. Many of these proteins are chromosomally associated, suggesting that this domain may be involved in interactions between trx and other highly conserved components of chromatin involved in transcription regulation. The sequence alterations of trx mutations identify the highly conserved regions of trx as critical for the function of these large proteins. We show that zygotically expressed trx RNAs encoding the larger protein isoform are initially expressed in a spatially restricted pattern which overlaps the expression domains of the BX-C genes Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B. This pattern is transient and evolves into a broader expression domain encompassing the entire germ band during the extended germ band stage. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

Here, we describe the biochemical purification and characterization of Set2, a novel HMT that is site-specific for lysine 36 (Lys36) of the H3 tail. Using an antiserum directed against Lys36 methylation in H3, we show that Set2, via its SET domain, is responsible for methylation at this site in vivo. Tethering of Set2 to a heterologous promoter reveals that Set2 represses transcription, and part of this repression is mediated through the HMT activity of the SET domain. These results suggest that Set2 and methylation at H3 Lys36 play a role in the repression of gene transcription.},

The principles that assure selective targeting of the DCC are unknown. According to a prevalent model, X chromosome targeting is initiated by recruitment of the DCC core components, MSL1 and MSL2, to a limited number of so-called "high-affinity sites" (HAS). Only very few such sites are known at the DNA sequence level, which has precluded the definition of DCC targeting principles. Combining RNA interference against DCC subunits, limited crosslinking, and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to probing high-resolution DNA microarrays, we identified a set of 131 HAS for MSL1 and MSL2 and confirmed their properties by various means. The HAS sites are distributed all over the X chromosome and are functionally important, since the extent of dosage compensation of a given gene and its proximity to a HAS are positively correlated. The sites are mainly located on noncoding parts of genes and predominantly map to regions that are devoid of nucleosomes. In contrast, the bulk of DCC binding is in coding regions and is marked by histone H3K36 methylation. Within the HAS, repetitive DNA sequences mainly based on GA and CA dinucleotides are enriched. Interestingly, DCC subcomplexes bind a small number of autosomal locations with similar features. \textcopyright{} 2008 Straub et al.}

At early stages, the germline blastomeres are maintained in a transcriptionally silent state by the transcriptional repressor PIE-1. When this silencing is lifted, it is postulated that correct patterns of germline gene expression are controlled, at least in part, by MES-mediated regulation of chromatin state. Accompanying transcriptional regulation by PIE-1 and the MES proteins, RNA metabolism in germ cells is likely to be regulated by perinuclear RNA-rich cytoplasmic granules, termed P granules. This chapter discusses the molecular nature and possible roles of these various germline regulators, and describes a recently discovered mechanism to protect somatic cells from following a germline fate.}

Here, we show that PUF-8, the C. elegans PUF most related to PUMILIO, performs a different function in germ cells that have begun meiosis: in primary spermatocytes, puf-8 is required to maintain meiosis and prevent the return to mitosis. Primary spermatocytes lacking PUF-8 complete meiotic prophase but do not undergo normal meiotic divisions. Instead, they dedifferentiate back into mitotically cycling germ cells and form rapidly growing tumors. These findings reveal an unexpected ability for germ cells that have completed meiotic prophase to return to the mitotic cycle, and they support the view that PUF proteins regulate multiple transitions during germline development.}

We have identified three genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that contain a putative zinc-binding domain similar to the one found in nanos, and show that two of these genes function during PGC development. Like Drosophila nanos, C. elegans nos-1 and nos-2 are not generally required for PGC fate specification, but instead regulate specific aspects of PGC development. nos-2 is expressed in PGCs around the time of gastrulation from a maternal RNA associated with P granules, and is required for the efficient incorporation of PGCs into the somatic gonad. nos-1 is expressed in PGCs after gastrulation, and is required redundantly with nos-2 to prevent PGCs from dividing in starved animals and to maintain germ cell viability during larval development. In the absence of nos-1 and nos-2, germ cells cease proliferation at the end of the second larval stage, and die in a manner that is partially dependent on the apoptosis gene ced-4. Our results also indicate that putative RNA-binding proteins related to Drosophila Pumilio are required for the same PGC processes as nos-1 and nos-2.

The binding of MCMs to chromatin oscillates in conjunction with progress through the mitotic cell cycle. This oscillation is thought to play an important role in coupling DNA replication to mitosis and limiting chromosome duplication to once per cell cycle. The coupling of DNA replication to mitosis is absent in Drosophila endoreplication cycles (endocycles), during which discrete rounds of chromosome duplication occur without intervening mitoses. We examined the behavior of MCM proteins in endoreplicating larval salivary glands, to determine whether oscillation of MCM-chromosome localization occurs in conjunction with passage through an endocycle S phase. We found that MCMs in polytene nuclei exist in two states: associated with or dissociated from chromosomes. We demonstrate that cyclin E can drive chromosome association of DmMCM2 and that DNA synthesis erases this association. We conclude that mitosis is not required for oscillations in chromosome binding of MCMs and propose that cycles of MCM-chromosome association normally occur in endocycles. These results are discussed in a model in which the cycle of MCM-chromosome associations is uncoupled from mitosis because of the distinctive program of cyclin expression in endocycles.}

The activation of ATM's kinase activity involves acetylation of ATM by the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. In this study, systematic mutagenesis of lysine residues was used to identify regulatory ATM acetylation sites. The results identify a single acetylation site at lysine 3016, which is located in the highly conserved C-terminal FATC domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Antibodies specific for acetyl-lysine 3016 demonstrate rapid (within 5 min) in vivo acetylation of ATM following exposure to bleomycin. Furthermore, lysine 3016 of ATM is a substrate in vitro for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. Mutation of lysine 3016 does not affect unstimulated ATM kinase activity but does abolish upregulation of ATM's kinase activity by DNA damage, inhibits the conversion of inactive ATM dimers to active ATM monomers, and prevents the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the p53 and chk2 proteins. These results are consistent with a model in which acetylation of lysine 3016 in the FATC domain of ATM activates the kinase activity of ATM. The acetylation of ATM on lysine 3016 by Tip60 is therefore a key step linking the detection of DNA damage and the activation of ATM kinase activity.}

The loss of H1 from GSCs causes their premature differentiation through activation of the key GSC differentiation factor bam. Interestingly, the acetylated H4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is selectively augmented in the H1-depleted GSCs. Furthermore, overexpression of mof reduces H1 association on chromatin. In contrast, the knocking down of mof significantly rescues the GSC loss phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that H1 functions intrinsically to promote GSC self-renewal by antagonizing MOF function.

However, its biochemical function is poorly understood. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of the huntingtin interacting protein B (HYPB). 1) The triplicate AWS-SET-PostSET domains mediate a histone H3 lysine 36 specific HMTase activity. 2) A low charged region that is rich in glutamine and proline has been characterized as a novel transcriptional activation domain. The structural features of this region are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. 3) Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicate that HYPB protein associates with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) but not the unphosphorylated form. Furthermore, the RNAPII-association region of HYPB protein has been identified to encompass the C-terminal 142 amino acids. Thus, our results suggest that HYPB HMTase may coordinate histone methylation and transcriptional regulation in mammals and open perspective for the further study of the potential roles of HYPB protein in hematopoiesis and pathogenesis of HD. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

However, the signal-transduction pathway linking DNA strand breaks to activation of ATM's kinase activity is not clearly defined. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage induces the rapid acetylation of ATM. This acetylation depends on the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT). Suppression of Tip60 blocks the activation of ATM's kinase activity and prevents the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and chk2. Further, inactivation of Tip60 sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. ATM forms a stable complex with Tip60 through the conserved FATC domain of ATM. The interaction between ATM and Tip60 is not regulated in response to DNA damage. Instead, the HAT activity of the ATM-Tip60 complex is specifically activated by DNA damage. Furthermore, this activation of Tip60 by DNA damage and the recruitment of the ATM-Tip60 complex to sites of DNA damage is independent of ATM's kinase activity. The results demonstrate that the Tip60 HAT plays a key role in the activation of ATM's kinase activity in response to DNA damage. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Cells are constantly exposed to genotoxic events that can damage DNA. To counter this, cells have evolved a series of highly conserved DNA repair pathways to maintain genomic integrity. The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. DSBs activate ATM's kinase activity, promoting the phosphorylation of proteins involved in both checkpoint activation and DNA repair. Recent work has revealed that two DNA damage response proteins, the Tip60 acetyltransferase and the mre11-rad50-nbs1 (MRN) complex, co-operate in the activation of ATM in response to DSBs. MRN functions to target ATM and the Tip60 acetyltransferase to DSBs. Tip60's chromodomain then interacts with histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9, activating Tip60's acetyltransferase activity and stimulating the subsequent acetylation and activation of ATM's kinase activity. These results underscore the importance of chromatin structure in regulating DNA damage signaling and emphasize how histone modifications co-ordinate DNA repair. In addition, human tumors frequently exhibit altered patterns of histone methylation. This rewriting of the histone methylation code in tumor cells may impact the efficiency of DSB repair, increasing genomic instability and contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer. \textcopyright{} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

To understand how chromosome folding accommodates transcription, we investigated the assembly of the axial element, the proteinaceous structure that compacts meiotic chromosomes and promotes recombination and fertility. We found that the axial element proteins of budding yeast are flexibly anchored to chromatin by the ring-like cohesin complex. The ubiquitous presence of cohesin at sites of convergent transcription provides well-dispersed points for axis attachment and thus chromosome compaction. Axis protein enrichment at these sites directly correlates with the propensity for recombination initiation nearby. A separate modulating mechanism that requires the conserved axial-element component Hop1 biases axis protein binding towards small chromosomes. Importantly, axis anchoring by cohesin is adjustable and readily displaced in the direction of transcription by the transcriptional machinery. We propose that such robust but flexible tethering allows the axial element to promote recombination while easily adapting to changes in chromosome activity.},

H3K36me2 is sufficient for recruitment of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress cryptic transcription from transcribed regions. In fission yeast, Set2 is also responsible for H3K36 methylation, which represses a subset of RNAs including heterochromatic and subtelomeric RNAs, at least in part via recruitment of Clr6 complex II, a homolog of Rpd3S. Here, we show that CTD-S2P-dependent interaction of fission yeast Set2 with Pol2 via the SRI domain is required for formation of H3K36me3, but not H3K36me2. H3K36me3 silenced heterochromatic and subtelomeric transcripts mainly through post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms, respectively, whereas H3K36me2 was not enough for silencing. Clr6 complex II appeared not to be responsible for heterochromatic silencing by H3K36me3. Our results demonstrate that H3K36 methylation has multiple outputs in fission yeast; these findings provide insights into the distinct roles of H3K36 methylation in metazoans, which have different enzymes for synthesis of H3K36me1/2 and H3K36me3.}

This is fundamental to the continuation of a species. Mouse NANOS3 is an essential protein required for the germ cell maintenance and is specifically expressed in these cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms that restrict the expression of this gene in the germ cells is largely unknown at present.Methodology/Principal Findings:In our current study, we show that differences in the stability of Nanos3 mRNA between germ cells and somatic cells is brought about in a 3{${'}$}UTR-dependent manner in mouse embryos. Although Nanos3 is transcribed in both cell lineages, it is efficiently translated only in the germ lineage. We also find that the translational suppression of NANOS3 in somatic cells is caused by a 3{${'}$}UTR-mediated mRNA destabilizing mechanism. Surprisingly, even when under the control of the CAG promoter which induces strong ubiquitous transcription in both germ cells and somatic cells, the addition of the Nanos3-3{${'}$}UTR sequence to the coding region of exogenous gene was effective in restricting protein expression in germ cells.Conclusions/Significance:Our current study thus suggests that Nanos3-3{${'}$}UTR has an essential role in translational control in the mouse embryo. \textcopyright{} 2010 Suzuki et al.}

Here, we describe a previously unknown posttranslational modification of the DNA-binding domain of p53. This modification, acetylation of lysine 120 (K120), occurs rapidly after DNA damage and is catalyzed by the MYST family acetyltransferases hMOF and TIP60. Mutation of K120 to arginine, as occurs in human cancer, debilitates K120 acetylation and diminishes p53-mediated apoptosis without affecting cell-cycle arrest. The K120R mutation selectively blocks the transcription of proapoptotic target genes such as BAX and PUMA while the nonapoptotic targets p21 and hMDM2 remain unaffected. Consistent with this, depletion of hMOF and/or TIP60 inhibits the ability of p53 to activate BAX and PUMA transcription. Furthermore, the acetyllysine 120 (acetyl-K120) form of p53 specifically accumulates at proapoptotic target genes. These data suggest that K120 acetylation may help distinguish the cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic functions of p53. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Thanks to recent high coverage mass-spectrometry studies and reconstructed protein complexes, we are now in an unprecedented position to study the evolution of biological systems. Gene duplications, known to be a major source of innovation in evolution, can now be readily examined in the context of protein complexes. Results. We observe that paralogs operating in the same complex fulfill different roles: mRNA dosage increase for more than a hundred cytosolic ribosomal proteins, mutually exclusive participation of at least 54 paralogs resulting in alternative forms of complexes, and 24 proteins contributing to bona fide structural growth. Inspection of paralogous proteins participating in two independent complexes shows that an ancient, pre-duplication protein functioned in both multi-protein assemblies and a gene duplication event allowed the respective copies to specialize and split their roles. Conclusion. Variants with conditionally assembled, paralogous subunits likely have played a role in yeast's adaptation to anaerobic conditions. In a number of cases the gene duplication has given rise to one duplicate that is no longer part of a protein complex and shows an accelerated rate of evolution. Such genes could provide the raw material for the evolution of new functions. \textcopyright{} 2008 Szklarczyk et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

Three-dimensional (3D) cryo-EM reconstructions of the core yeast complex, combined with immunolabeling and two-dimensional (2D) EM analysis of the individual subcomplexes reveal a Y-shaped architecture with Cps50 and Cps30 localizing on the top two adjacent lobes and Cps60-Cps25 forming the base at the bottom. EM analysis of the human complex reveals a striking similarity to its yeast counterpart, suggesting a common subunit organization. The SET domain of Set1 is located at the juncture of Cps50, Cps30, and the Cps60-Cps25 module, lining the walls of a central channel that may act as the platform for catalysis and regulative processing of various degrees of H3K4 methylation.

A small number of spermatogonia formed colonies when testis fragments from a Ret mutant mouse strain were transplanted into heterologous recipients. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) supplementation enabled in vitro SSC expansion without GDNF. Although GDNF-mediated self-renewal signaling required both AKT and MAP2K1/2, the latter was dispensable in FGF2-mediated self-renewal. FGF2-depleted testes exhibited increased levels of GDNF and were enriched for SSCs, suggesting that the balance between FGF2 and GDNF levels influences SSC self-renewal in vivo. Our results show that SSCs exhibit at least two modes of self-renewal and suggest complexity of SSC regulation in vivo.}

During oocyte growth, the GV chromatin condenses into perinucleolar rings (the SN configuration) or other corresponding configurations with or without the perinucleolar rings, depending on species. During oocyte maturation, the GV chromatin is synchronized in a less condensed state before germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in species that has been minutely studied. Oocytes may also take on a SN/corresponding configuration during early atresia, but they undergo GVBD at the advanced stage of atresia. As not all the species show the SN configuration while in all the species, gene transcription always stops at the late stage of oocyte growth, it is suggested that not the formation of perinucleolar rings but a thorough condensation of GV chromatin is essential for transcriptional repression. The GV chromatin configuration is highly correlated with oocyte competence; oocytes must end the NSN configuration before they gain the full meiotic competence, and they must take on the SN/ corresponding configurations and stop gene transcription before they acquire the competence for early embryonic development. While factors inhibiting follicle atresia tend to synchronize oocytes in a chromatin configuration toward maturation, factors inducing follicle atresia tend to synchronize oocytes in a chromatin configuration reminiscent of early atresia. Furthermore, although condensation of GV chromatin is associated with transcriptional repression, both processes may not be associated with histone deacetylation during oocyte growth. \textcopyright{} The Author 2008.

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are not well understood. Here, we show that Tip60 is required for both cell growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by p53 and also induces its acetylation specifically at lysine 120 (K120) within the DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, this modification is crucial for p53-dependent apoptosis but is dispensable for its mediated growth arrest. K120 is a recurrent site for p53 mutation in human cancer, and the corresponding acetylation-defective tumor mutant (K120R) abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis, but not growth arrest. Thus, our study demonstrates that Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 at K120 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it reveals that the DNA-binding core domain is an important target for p53 regulation by posttranslational modifications. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The recent identification of intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalytic activity from a number of transcriptional co-activators (including yeast GCN5, (p)300/CBP, P/CAF, and TAFII250), has underscored the importance of protein acetylation in transcriptional control. The GCN5 family is the prototype for a diverse group of at least four distinct human HATs families. Although there is now a clear link between in vivo HAT catalytic activity and gene activation, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of histone acetylation. Herein, we report the first detailed biochemical study that probes the catalytic mechanism and the function of invariant glutamic acid 173 within the GCN5 family of HATs. Our results suggest that the HAT reaction involves the formation of a ternary complex (histones, acetyl-CoA, and enzyme) where the {$\epsilon$}-amino group of histone lysine residues directly attacks the bound acetyl-CoA. The acetylation reaction requires deprotonation of the {$\epsilon$}-amino group prior to nucleophilic attack. Employing site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, steady-state, and pH-dependent rate analysis, it is demonstrated that glutamic acid 173 is an essential catalytic residue, acting as a general base catalyst by deprotonating the histone substrate.},

  abstract = {Compared with histone H3, acetylation of H4 tails has not been well studied, especially in mammalian cells. Yet, H4K16 acetylation is of particular interest because of its ability to decompact nucleosomes in vitro and its involvement in dosage compensation in flies. Here we show that, surprisingly, loss of H4K16 acetylation does not alter higher-order chromatin compaction in vivo in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). As well as peaks of acetylated H4K16 and KAT8 histone acetyltransferase at the transcription start sites of expressed genes, we report that acetylation of H4K16 is a new marker of active enhancers in ESCs and that some enhancers are marked by H3K4me1, KAT8, and H4K16ac, but not by acetylated H3K27 or EP300, suggesting that they are novel EP300 independent regulatory elements. Our data suggest a broad role for different histone acetylation marks and for different histone acetyltransferases in long-range gene regulation. \textcopyright{} 2013 Taylor et al.}

  abstract = {Background: The Drosophila olfactory system exhibits very precise and stereotyped wiring that is specified predominantly by genetic programming. Dendrites of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) pattern the developing antennal lobe before olfactory receptor neuron axon arrival, indicating an intrinsic wiring mechanism for PN dendrites. These wiring decisions are likely determined through a transcriptional program.Results: We find that loss of Brahma associated protein 55 kD (Bap55) results in a highly specific PN mistargeting phenotype. In Bap55 mutants, PNs that normally target to the DL1 glomerulus mistarget to the DA4l glomerulus with 100\% penetrance. Loss of Bap55 also causes derepression of a GAL4 whose expression is normally restricted to a small subset of PNs. Bap55 is a member of both the Brahma (BRM) and the Tat interactive protein 60 kD (TIP60) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. The Bap55 mutant phenotype is partially recapitulated by Domino and Enhancer of Polycomb mutants, members of the TIP60 complex. However, distinct phenotypes are seen in Brahma and Snf5-related 1 mutants, members of the BRM complex. The Bap55 mutant phenotype can be rescued by postmitotic expression of Bap55, or its human homologs BAF53a and BAF53b.Conclusions: Our results suggest that Bap55 functions through the TIP60 chromatin remodeling complex to regulate dendrite wiring specificity in PNs. The specificity of the mutant phenotypes suggests a position for the TIP60 complex at the top of a regulatory hierarchy that orchestrates dendrite targeting decisions. \textcopyright{} 2011 Tea and Luo; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

While the mechanism of transport through the bridges has not been adequately studied, there can be no question about the fact that movement in the system as a whole is strongly polarized. Thus, during their most active period of synthesis, the nurse cells in some species retain a relatively constant size, while the oocyte undergoes a slow but steady growth. A recent study of the oocyte-nurse cell complex in Hyalophora cecropia provided a clue to the physiological basis of bridge polarity. A10 mV potential gradient is found to be maintained between the nurse cells and the oocyte during the several days period when cytoplasmic transfer occurs. The direction of the gradient is consistent being a driving force behind the movement of negatively charged materials, such as ribosomes, and other forms of oocyte RNA that are known to be synthesized in the nurse cell. This chapter summarizes the literature on the development and function of the oocyte\textendash nurse cell complex to examine the relations between these cells. \textcopyright{} 1975, Academic Press Inc.

When food is in short supply, oogenesis is arrested and apoptosis of the nurse cells is induced at mid-oogenesis via a mechanism that is probably controlled by ecdysteroid hormone. We have shown that expression of some ecdysone-response genes is correlated with apoptosis of egg chambers. Moreover, ecdysteroid injection and application of juvenile hormone induces and suppresses the apoptosis, respectively. In this study, we investigated which tissues show increases in the concentration of ecdysteroids under nutritional shortage to begin to link together nutrient intake, hormone regulation and the choice between egg development or apoptosis made within egg chambers. We measured ecdysteroid levels in the whole body, ovaries and haemolymph samples by RIA and found that the concentration of ecdysteroid increased in all samples. This contributes to the idea that nutritional shortage leads to a rapid high ecdysteroid concentration within the fly and that the high concentration induces apoptosis. Low concentrations of ecdysteroid are essential for normal oogenesis. We suggest there is threshold concentration in the egg chambers and that apoptosis at mid-oogenesis is induced when the ecdysteroid levels exceed the threshold. Starvation causes the ovary to retain the ecdysteroid it produces, thus enabling individual egg chambers to undergo apoptosis and thus control the number of eggs. produced in relation to food intake. \textcopyright{} 2005 Society for Endocrinology.}

A large percentage of these repeats are interrupted in the 28S region by insertions of two types. We compared the restriction patterns from a subcloned wild-type Oregon R strain to those of spontaneous and ethyl methanesulfonate-induced bobbed mutants. Bobbed mutations were found to be deficiencies that modified the organization of the rDNA locus. Genes without insertions were deleted about twice as often as genes with type I insertions. Type II insertion genes were not decreased in number, except in the mutant having the most bobbed phenotype. Reversion to wild type was associated with an increase in gene copy number, affecting exclusively genes without insertions. One hypothesis which explains these results is the partial clustering of genes by type. The initial deletion could then be due either to an unequal crossover or to loss of material without exchange. Some of our findings indicated that deletion may be associated with an amplification phenomenon, the magnitude of which would be dependent on the amount of clustering of specific gene types at the locus.}

Machinery based on small non-coding piRNAs has evolved to inhibit their expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Surprisingly, this machinery is weakened during specific windows of time in mice, flies or plants, allowing the expression of TEs in germline cells. The function of this de-repression remains unknown. In Drosophila, we have previously shown that this developmental window is characterized by a reduction of Piwi expression in dividing germ cells. Here, we show that the unique knock-down of Aub in these cells leads to female sterility. It correlates with defects in piRNA amplification, an increased Piwi expression and an increased silencing of transcriptionally silenced TEs. These defects are similar to those observed when Aub is depleted in the whole germline which underlies the crucial role of this developmental window for both oogenesis and TE silencing. We further show that, with age, some fertility is recovered which is concomitant to a decrease of Piwi and TE silencing. These data pinpoint the Pilp as a tremendously important step for female fertility and genome stability. They further show that such a restricted developmental niche of germ cells may sense environmental changes, such as aging, to protect the germline all along the life.},

Although the cysts are syncytial, the 16 cells differentiate to form a single oocyte and 15 nurse cells, and several mRNAs that are synthesized in the nurse cells accumulate specifically in the oocyte. To gain insight into the mechanisms that generate the cytoplasmic asymmetry within these cysts, we have examined cytoskeletal organization during oocyte differentiation. Shortly after formation of the 16 cell cysts, a prominent microtubule organizing center (MTOC) is established within the syncytial cytoplasm, and at the time the oocyte is determined, a single microtubule cytoskeleton connects the oocyte with the remaining 15 cells of each cyst. Recessive mutations at the Bicaudal-D (Bic-D) and egalitarian (egl) loci, which block oocyte differentiation, disrupt formation and maintenance of this polarized microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubule assembly-inhibitors phenocopy these mutations, and prevent oocyte-specific accumulation of oskar, cyclin B and 65F mRNAs. We propose that formation of the polarized microtubule cytoskeleton is required for oocyte differentiation, and that this structure mediates the asymmetric accumulation of mRNAs within the syncytial cysts.},

PIC formation usually begins with TFIID binding to the TATA box, initiator, and/or downstream promoter element (DPE) found in most core promoters, followed by the entry of other general transcription factors (GTFs) and pol II through either a sequential assembly or a preassembled pol II holoenzyme pathway. Formation of this promoter-bound complex is sufficient for a basal level of transcription. However, for activator-dependent (or regulated) transcription, general cofactors are often required to transmit regulatory signals between gene-specific activators and the general transcription machinery. Three classes of general cofactors, including TBP-associated factors (TAFs), Mediator, and upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived positive cofactors (PC1/PARP-1, PC2, PC3/DNA topoisomerase I, and PC4) and negative cofactor 1 (NC1/HMGB1), normally function independently or in combination to fine-tune the promoter activity in a gene-specific or cell-type-specific manner. In addition, other cofactors, such as TAF1, BTAF1, and negative cofactor 2 (NC2), can also modulate TBP or TFIID binding to the core promoter. In general, these cofactors are capable of repressing basal transcription when activators are absent and stimulating transcription in the presence of activators. Here we review the roles of these cofactors and GTFs, as well as TBP-related factors (TRFs), TAF-containing complexes (TFTC, SAGA, SLIK/SALSA, STAGA, and PRC1) and TAF variants, in pol II-mediated transcription, with emphasis on the events occurring after the chromatin has been remodeled but prior to the formation of the first phosphodiester bond.}

However, the molecular events that regulate p300 HAT activity are poorly understood. We evaluated autoacetylation of the p300 HAT protein domain to determine its function. Using expressed protein ligation, the p300 HAT protein domain was generated in hypoacetylated form and found to have reduced catalytic activity. This basal catalytic rate was stimulated by autoacetylation of several key lysine sites within an apparent activation loop motif. This post-translational modification and catalytic regulation of p300 HAT activity is conceptually analogous to the activation of most protein kinases by autophosphorylation. We therefore propose that this autoregulatory loop could influence the impact of p300 on a wide variety of signaling and transcriptional events.},

  abstract = {In the Drosophila ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) physically interact with their niche composed of terminal filament cells, cap cells, and possibly GSC-contacting escort cells (ECs). A GSC divides to generate a self-renewing stem cell that remains in the niche and a differentiating daughter that moves away from the niche. The GSC niche provides a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal that maintains GSC self-renewal by preventing stem cell differentiation via repression of the differentiation-promoting gene bag of marbles (bam). In addition, it expresses E-cadherin, which mediates cell adhesion for anchoring GSCs in the niche, enabling continuous self-renewal. GSCs themselves also express different classes of intrinsic factors, including signal transducers, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, translation regulators, and miRNAs, which control self-renewal by strengthening interactions with the niche and repressing various differentiation pathways. Differentiated GSC daughters, known as cystoblasts (CBs), also express distinct classes of intrinsic factors to inhibit self-renewal and promote germ cell differentiation. Surprisingly, GSC progeny are also dependent on their surrounding ECs for proper differentiation at least partly by preventing BMP from diffusing to the differentiated germ cell zone and by repressing ectopic BMP expression. Therefore, both GSC self-renewal and CB differentiation are controlled by collaborative actions of extrinsic signals and intrinsic factors.

Having succeeded in reconstituting a functionally active TFIIH from baculovirus recombinant polypeptides, we were able to analyze the role of XPB, XPD, and cdk7 subunits in the transcription reaction. Designing mutated recombinant subunits, we show that the XPB helicase is absolutely required for transcription to open the promoter around the start site whereas the XPD helicase, which is dispensable, stimulates transcription and allows the CAK complex to be anchored to TFIIH. In addition, we also show that cdk7 may phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II in the absence of promoter opening.},

Here we report that a 15-kDa cellular protein called EAP (for EBER associated protein), previously shown to bind EBER1, is in fact the ribosomal protein L22. Approximately half of the L22 in EBV-positive cells is contained within the EBER1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, whereas the other half residues in monoribosomes and polysomes. Immunofluorescence with anti-L22 antibodies demonstrates that L22 is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleoli of uninfected human cells, as expected, whereas EBV-positive lymphocytes also show strong nucleoplasmic staining. In situ hybridization indicates that the EBER RNPs are predominantly nucleoplasmic, suggesting that L22 relocalization correlates with binding to EBER1 in vivo. Since incubation of uninfected cell extracts with excess EBER1 RNA does not remove L22 from preexisting ribosomes, in vivo binding of L22 by EBER1 may precede ribosome assembly. The gene encoding L22 has recently been identified as the target of a chromosomal translocation in certain patients with leukemia, suggesting that L22 levels may be a determinant in cell transformation.},

  abstract = {Background: A multitude of recent studies has observed common epigenetic changes develop in tumour cells of multiple lineages following exposure to stresses such as hypoxia, chemotherapeutics, immunotherapy or targeted therapies. A significant increase in the transcriptionally repressive mark trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) is becoming associated with treatment-resistant phenotypes suggesting upstream mechanisms may be a good target for therapy. We have reported that the increase in H3K9me3 is derived from the methyltransferases SETDB1 and SETDB2 following treatment in melanoma, lung, breast and colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as melanoma patient data. Other groups have observed a number of characteristics such as epigenetic remodelling, increased interferon signalling, cell cycle inhibition and apoptotic resistance that have also been reported by us suggesting these independent studies are investigating similar or identical phenomena. Main body: Firstly, this review introduces reports of therapy-induced reprogramming in cancer populations with highly similar slow-cycling phenotypes that suggest a role for both IFN signalling and epigenetic remodelling in the acquisition of drug tolerance. We then describe plausible connections between the type 1 IFN pathway, slow-cycling phenotypes and these epigenetic mechanisms before reviewing recent evidence on the roles of SETDB1 and SETDB2, alongside their product H3K9me3, in treatment-induced reprogramming and promotion of drug resistance. The potential mechanisms for the activation of SETDB1 and SETDB2 and how they might arise in treatment is also discussed mechanistically, with a focus on their putative induction by inflammatory signalling. Moreover, we theorise their timely role in attenuating inflammation after their activation in order to promote a more resilient phenotype through homeostatic coordination of H3K9me3. We also examine the relatively uncharacterized functions of SETDB2 with some comparison to the more well-known qualities of SETDB1. Finally, an emerging overall mechanism for the epigenetic maintenance of this transient phenotype is outlined by summarising the collective literature herein. Conclusion: A number of converging phenotypes outline a stress-responsive mechanism for SETDB1 and SETDB2 activation and subsequent increased survival, providing novel insights into epigenetic biology. A clearer understanding of how SETDB1/2-mediated transcriptional reprogramming can subvert treatment responses will be invaluable in improving length and efficacy of modern therapies.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) have the capacity to replicate and insert into new genomic locations. This contributed significantly to evolution of genomes, but can also result in DNA breaks and illegitimate recombination, and therefore posing a significant threat to genomic integrity. Excess damage to the germ cell genome results in sterility. A specific RNA silencing pathway, termed the piRNA pathway operates in germ cells of animals to control TE activity. At the core of the piRNA pathway is a ribonucleo-protein complex consisting of a small RNA, called piRNA, and a protein from the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute nucleases. The piRNA pathway relies on the specificity provided by the piRNAs to recognize TEs targets, while effector functions are provided by the PIWI protein. PIWI-piRNA complexes silence TEs both at the transcriptional level \textendash{} by attracting repressive chromatin modifications to genomic targets \textendash{} and at the post-transcriptional level \textendash{} by cleaving TE transcripts in the cytoplasm. Impairment of the piRNA pathway leads to overexpression of TEs, significantly compromised genome structure and, invariably, germ cells death and sterility., The piRNA pathway is best understood in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in mouse. This Chapter gives an overview of current knowledge on piRNA biogenesis, and mechanistic details of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional TE silencing by the piRNA pathway. It further focuses on the importance of post-translational modifications and subcellular localization of the piRNA machinery. Finally, it provides a brief description of analogous pathways in other systems.},

We screened for dominant modifiers of the bullwinkle moose-antler eggshell phenotype and identified shark, which encodes an SH2-domain, ankyrin-repeat tyrosine kinase. At the onset of dorsal-appendage formation, shark is expressed in a punctate pattern in the squamous stretch cells overlying the nurse cells. Confocal microscopy with cell-type-specific parkers demonstrates that the stretch cells act as a substrate for the migrating dorsal-appendage-forming cells and extend cellular projections towards them. Mosaic analyses reveal that shark is required in follicle cells for cell migration and chorion deposition. Proper shark RNA expression in the stretch cells requires bwk activity, while restoration of shark expression in the stretch cells suppresses the bwk dorsal-appendage phenotype. These results suggest that shark plays an important downstream role in the bwk-signaling pathway. Candidate testing implicates Src42A in a similar role, suggesting conservation with a vertebrate signaling pathway involving non-receptor tyrosine kinases.},

Here, we present the high resolution crystal structure of the HAT domain of yGCN5 and probe the functional importance of a conserved glutamate residue. The structure reveals a central protein core associated with AcCoA binding that appears to be structurally conserved among a superfamily of N- acetyltransferases, including yeast histone acetyltransferase 1 and Serratia marcescens aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase. A pronounced cleft lying above this core, and flanked by N- and C-terminal regions that show no sequence conservation within N-acetyltransferase enzymes, is implicated by cross-species conservation and mutagenesis studies to be a site for histone substrate binding and catalysis. Located at the bottom of this cleft is a conserved glutamate residue (E173) that is in position to play an important catalytic role in histone acetylation. Functional analysis of an E173Q mutant yGCN5 protein implicates glutamate 173 to function as a general base for catalysis. Together, a correlation of the yGCN5 structure with functionally debilitating yGCN5 mutations provides a paradigm for understanding the structure/function relationships of the growing number of transcriptional regulators that function as histone acetyltransferase enzymes.}

The homology of Su(var)3-9 to both negative (Polycomb and Enhancer of zeste) and positive (trithorax) regulators of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes also suggests similarities in the molecular processes connected with stable transmission of a determined state and the clonal propagation of heterochromatinization.},

Whereas most covalent histone modifications are reversible, until recently it was unknown whether methyl groups could be actively removed from histones.

In the presence of Fe(II) and {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate, JHDM1 demethylates H3-methyl-K36 and generates formaldehyde and succinate. Overexpression of JHDM1 reduced the level of dimethyl-H3-K36 (H3K36me2) in vivo. The demethylase activity of the JmjC domain-containing proteins is conserved, as a JHDM1 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae also has H3-K36 demethylase activity. Thus, we identify the JmjC domain as a novel demethylase signature motif and uncover a protein demethylation mechanism that is conserved from yeast to human. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

Here, we reported that how SETDB1's enzymatic activities can be regulated by the nuclear protein, ATF7IP, a known binding partner of SETDB1. Mechanistically, ATF7IP mediates SETDB1 retention inside the nucleus, presumably by inhibiting its nuclear export by binding to the N-terminal region of SETDB1, which harbors the nuclear export signal motifs, and also by promoting its nuclear import. The nuclear localization of SETDB1 increases its ubiquitinated, enzymatically more active form. Our results provided an insight as to how ATF7IP can regulate the histone methyltransferase activity of SETDB1 accompanied by its nuclear translocation., Nuclear protein ATF7IP promotes the nuclear localization of the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1.

  abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key endocrine regulator of insect metamorphosis, reproduction, and aging. The synthesis of JH is regulated by neuropeptides and biogenic amines, but the molecular and cellular basis of this control remains largely unknown. Genetic analysis of JH synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster mutant for insulin signaling may provide new and powerful insights. Mutants of the insulin receptor (InR) are slow to develop, small, infertile, and long-lived. We previously reported that mutants of InR had reduced JH synthesis as young adults, and that normal longevity and vitellogenesis were restored by topical application of a JH analog [Science 292 (2001) 107]. Here, we describe the 10-day adult age course of JH synthesis from isolated corpus allatum (CA) of InR and of chico, the insulin receptor substrate homolog. JH synthesis increased in wildtype flies to a maximum of 30 fmol/gland/h at day 10. In contrast, homozygous InR mutants produced no more than 3 fmol/gland/h JH within the first 5 days, and only 7 fmol/gland/h at day 10. InR mutation disproportionately reduced the synthesis of JH III-bisepoxide, the major JH subtype of the fly. Mutation of chico also reduces body size and extends longevity [Science 292 (2001) 104; Aging Cell 1 (2002a) 75]. Both homozygous and heterozygous chico genotypes reduced JH synthesis, but only to 47 and 67\%, respectively, of wildtype and without influencing the ratio of JH subtypes. Because JH synthetic rate does not correlate with the size of CA, it is not likely that insulin signaling mediates JH by impeding endocrine tissue development. Alternatively, we find allatotropin-positive axons to be abundant in the adult brain and in the corpora cardiaca-corpus allatum complex but these neurons are less immunoreactive in the InR mutant genotype, suggesting that insulin signaling may affect JH synthesis through control of JH regulatory neuropeptides. \textcopyright{} 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Herein, we show that Etv5 mRNA was present in perinatal mouse testis and that ETV5 was expressed in fetal Sertoli cells and by germ cells and Sertoli cells during the neonatal period. Transplantation of Etv5(-/-) germ cells failed to establish spermatogenesis in W/W(v) mice testes, indicating that germ cell ETV5 has a key role in establishment or self-renewal of transplanted SSCs. The SSC self-renewal is stimulated by glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) acting through the RET/GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRA1) receptor complex in SSCs. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and laser capture microdissection revealed decreased RET mRNA and protein expression in spermatogonia of neonatal Etv5(-/-) mice by Postnatal Days 4-8, indicating that disrupted GDNF/RET/GFRA1 signaling may occur before initial spermatogonial stem/progenitor cell decrease. Etv5(-/-) spermatogonia had reduced proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Decreased cell proliferation may cause the observed decreases in the number of type A spermatogonia (Postnatal Day 17) and daily sperm production (Postnatal Day 30) in Etv5(-/-) mice, indicating quantitative impairments in the first wave of spermatogenesis. In conclusion, ETV5 is expressed beginning in fetal Sertoli cells and can potentially have effects on neonatal Sertoli cells and germ cells. In addition, ETV5 has critical effects on neonatal spermatogonial proliferation, which may involve impaired signaling through the RET receptor.}

We have now analyzed CYP26A1 and CYP26C1 function by generating knockout mice. Loss of CYP26C1 did not appear to affect embryonic development, suggesting that CYP26A1 and CYP26C1 are functionally redundant. In contrast, mice lacking both CYP26A1 and CYP26C1 were found to manifest a pronounced anterior truncation of the brain associated with A-P patterning defects that reflect expansion of posterior identity at the expense of anterior identity.

  abstract = {Recognition of acetylated chromatin by the bromodomains and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins is a hallmark for transcriptional activation and anchoring viral genomes to mitotic chromosomes of the host. One of the BET family proteins BRD2 interacts with acetylated chromatin during mitosis and leads to transcriptional activation in culture cells. Here, we report the crystal structures of the N-terminal bromodomain of human BRD2(BRD2-BD1; residues 74-194) in complex with each of three different Lys-12-acetylated H4 peptides. The BRD2-BD1 recognizes the H4tail acetylated at Lys-12 (H4K12ac), whereas the side chain of hypoacetylated Lys-8 of H4 binds at the cavity of the dimer interface of BRD2-BD1. From binding studies, we identified the BRD2-BD1 residues that are responsible for recognition of the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail. In addition, mutation to Lys-8 in the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail decreased the binding to BRD2-BD1, implicating the critical role of Lys-8 in the Lys-12-acetylated H4 tail for the recognition by BRD2-BD1. Our findings provide a structural basis for deciphering the histone code by the BET bromodomain through the binding with a long segment of the histone H4 tail, which presumably prevents erasure of the histone code during the cell cycle.}

GSC differentiation in Drosophila oogenesis requires expression of the histone methyltransferase dSETDB1 by the somatic niche, however its function in this process is unknown. Here, we show that dSETDB1 is required for the expression of a Wnt ligand, Drosophila Wingless type mouse mammary virus integration site number 4 (dWnt4) in the somatic niche. dWnt4 signaling acts on the somatic niche cells to facilitate their encapsulation of the GSC daughter, which serves as a differentiation cue. dSETDB1 is known to repress transposable elements (TEs) to maintain genome integrity. Unexpectedly, we found that independent upregulation of TEs also downregulated dWnt4, leading to GSC differentiation defects. This suggests that dWnt4 expression is sensitive to the presence of TEs. Together our results reveal a chromatin-transposon-Wnt signaling axis that regulates stem cell fate.},

In Drosophila, germ granules have been implicated in germline determination [2]. C. Elegans germ granules, known as P granules, do not appear to be required for primordial germ cell (PGC) determination [3], but their components are still needed for fertility [4-6]. One potential role for P granules is to maintain germline fate and totipotency. This is suggested by the loss of P granules from germ cells that transform into somatic cell types, e.g., in germlines lacking MEX-3 and GLD-1 or upon neuronal induction by CHE-1 [7, 8]. However, it has not been established whether loss of P granules is the cause or effect of cell fate transformation. To test cause and effect, we severely compromised P granules by simultaneously knocking down factors that nucleate granule formation (PGL-1 and PGL-3) and promote their perinuclear localization (GLH-1 and GLH-4) [9] and investigated whether this causes germ cells to lose totipotency and initiate somatic reprogramming. We found that compromising P granules causes germ cells to express neuronal and muscle markers and send out neurite-like projections, suggesting that P granules maintain totipotency and germline identity by antagonizing somatic fate. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

  abstract = {The organization of the eukaryotic cell into discrete membrane-bound organelles allows for the separation of incompatible biochemical processes, but the activities of these organelles must be coordinated. For example, lipid metabolism is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for {$\beta$}-oxidation, and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling. It is increasingly recognized that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image. Here we present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light sheet instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles, that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics.},

We show that the role of Nup170p in subtelomeric gene silencing is linked to its association with the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex and the silencing factor Sir4p, and that the binding of Nup170p and Sir4p to subtelomeric chromatin is cooperative and necessary for the association of telomeres with the nuclear envelope.

  abstract = {Activation of the zygotic genome is a prerequisite for the transition from maternal to zygotic control of development. The onset of zygotic transcription has been well studied in somatic cells, but evidence suggests that it is controlled differently In the germline. In Drosophila, zygotic transcription in the soma has been detected as early as one hour after egg laying (AEL) [1]. In the germline, general RNA synthesis is not detected until 3.5 hours AEL (stage 8) [2] and poly(A)-containing transcripts are not observed in early germ cell nuclei [3]. However, rRNA gene expression has been demonstrated at this time [4]. Therefore, either there is a general, low level activation of the genome in early germ cells, or specific classes of genes, such as those transcribed by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II, are repressed. We addressed this issue by localizing the potent transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 to the germline, and we find that Gal4-VP16-dependent gene expression is repressed in early germ cells. In addition, localization of germ plasm to the anterior reveals that it is sufficient to repress Bicold-dependent gene expression. Thus, even in the presence of known transcriptional activators, RNAP II dependent gene expression is actively repressed in early germ cells. Furthermore, once the germ cell genome is activated, we find that vasa is expressed specifically in germ cells. This expression does not require proper patterning of the soma, indicating that it is likely to he controlled by the germ plasm.},

Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have shown that Motlp and NC2 play important roles in inhibiting TBP activity. To understand how TBP activity is regulated in a genome-wide manner, we profiled the binding of TBP, NC2, Motlp, TFIID, SAGA, and pol II across the yeast genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip for cells in exponential growth and during reprogramming of transcription. We find that TBP, NC2, and Motlp colocalize at transcriptionally active pol II core promoters. Relative binding of NC2{$\alpha$} and Motlp is higher at TATA promoters, whereas NC{$\beta$} has a preference for TATA-less promoters. In line with the ChIP-chip data, we isolated a stable TBP-NC2-Mot1p-DNA complex from chromatin extracts. ATP hydrolysis releases NC2 and DNA from the Mot1p-TBP complex. In vivo experiments indicate that promoter dissociation of TBP and NC2 is highly dynamic, which is dependent on Mot1p function. Based on these results, we propose that NC2 and Motlp cooperate to dynamically restrict TBP activity on transcribed promoters. \textcopyright{} 2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

For example, bivalent domains consisting of regions of H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) mark lineage control genes in ES cells and zebrafish blastomeres. Such bivalent domains have garnered attention because the H3K27me3 mark might help repress lineage-regulatory genes during pluripotency while the H3K4me3 mark could poise genes for activation upon differentiation. Despite the prominence of the bivalent domain concept, studies in other model organisms have questioned its universal nature, and the function of bivalent domains has remained unclear. Histone marks are also associated with developmental regulatory genes in sperm. These observations have raised the possibility that specific histone modification patterns might persist from parent to offspring, but it is unclear whether histone marks are inherited or formed de novo. Here, we review the potential roles of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in embryos and ES cells and discuss how histone marks might be established, maintained and resolved during embryonic development. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

The extent of methylation and its genomic distribution is determined by different factors that coordinate to achieve a functional outcome. In yeast, the Set2-mediated H3K36me is involved in suppressing histone exchange, preventing hyperacetylation and promoting maintenance of well-spaced chromatin structure over the coding regions. In metazoans, separation of this enzymatic activity affords greater functional diversity extending beyond the control of transcription elongation to developmental gene regulation.

Selective loss of H3K4me3 reduces transcription from and TFIID binding to a subset of promoters in vivo. Equilibrium binding assays and competition experiments show that the TAF3 PHD finger is highly selective for H3K4me3. In transient assays, TAF3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator in a PHD finger-dependent manner. Interestingly, asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 selectively inhibits TFIID binding to H3K4me3, whereas acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates TFIID interaction. Our experiments reveal crosstalk between histone modifications and the transcription factor TFIID.

One subregion coincides to the AZF region defined recently in distal Yq11. The second and third subregion were mapped proximal to it, in proximal and middle Yq11, respectively. The different deletions observed were not overlapping but the extension of the deleted Y DNA in each subregion was similar in each patient analysed. In testis tissue sections, disruption of spermatogenesis was shown to be at the same phase when the microdeletion occurred in the same Yq11 subregion but at a different phase when the microdeletion occurred in a different Yq11 subregion. Therefore, we propose the presence of not one but three spermatogenesis loci in Yq11 and that each locus is active during a different phase of male germ cell development.

Expression levels of gurken (grk), oskar (osk), bicoid (bcd), and decapentaplegic (dpp) transcripts are normal, with a slight delay in the appearance of bcd and dpp mRNAs. Mislocalization of grk and osk transcripts, however, suggests a defect in the microtubule reorganization that occurs during the middle stages of oogenesis and determines axial polaris. This defect likely results from aberrant Grk/Egfr signaling at earlier stages, since rhi mutations delay synthesis of Grk protein in germaria and early egg chambers. In addition, Grk protein accumulates in large, actin-caged vesicles near the endoplasmic reticulum of stages 6-10 egg chambers. We propose two hypotheses to explain these results. First, Rhi may play dual roles in oogenesis, independently regulating chromosome compaction in nurse cells at the end of the unique endoreplication cycle 5 and repressing transcription of genes that inhibit Grk synthesis. Thus, loss-of-function mutations arrest nurse cell chromosome reorganization at the five-blob stage and delay production or processing of Grk protein, leading to axial patterning defects. Second, Rhi may regulate chromosome compaction in both nurse cells and oocyte. Loss-of-function mutations block nurse cell nuclear transitions at the five-blob stage and activate checkpoint controls in the oocyte that arrest Grk synthesis and/or inhibit cytoskeletal functions. These functions may involve direct binding of Rhi to chromosomes or may involve indirect effects on pathways controlling these processes.},

Oocytes arrest in prophase I to permit oocyte differentiation, and in most animals, a second meiotic arrest links completion of meiosis to fertilization. Comparison of oocyte maturation and egg activation between mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila reveal conserved signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms as well as unique adaptations for reproductive strategies. Recent studies in mammals and C. elegans show the role of signaling between surrounding somatic cells and the oocyte in maintaining the prophase I arrest and controlling maturation. Proteins that regulate levels of active Cdk1/ cyclin B during prophase I arrest have been identified in Drosophila. Protein kinases play crucial roles in the transition from meiosis in the oocyte to mitotic embryonic divisions in C. elegans and Drosophila. Here we will contrast the regulation of key meiotic events in oocytes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

To identify BrdU-labeled spermatogenic cells, the spermatogenic stages must be determined by visualizing acrosomes and detecting cell type-specific marker molecules in the seminiferous tubules. However, the antibody reaction with BrdU routinely requires denaturation of the DNA, which is achieved by pretreating tissue sections with hydrochloric acid; however, this commonly interferes with further histochemical approaches. Therefore, we examined optimal methods for pretreating paraffin sections of the mouse testis to detect incorporated BrdU by an antibody and, at the same time, visualize acrosomes with peanut agglutinin (PNA) or detect several marker molecules with antibodies. We found that the use of heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIAR), which consisted of heating at 95C in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) for 15 min, was superior to the use of 2 N hydrochloric acid for 90 min at room temperature in terms of the quality of subsequent PNA-lectin histochemistry with double IHC for BrdU and an appropriate stage marker protein. With this method, we identified BrdU-labeled spermatogenic cells during mouse spermatogenesis as A1 spermatogonia through to preleptotene spermatocytes.},

Although essential to cell viability and development, the exact role of m6 A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m 6 A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m6 A in basic biological functions and disease. Here we show that m6 A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) 'reader' protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m6 A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6 A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m6 A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.}

Set2 is recruited to transcribed chromatin through its SRI domain's direct association with phosphorylated Pol II. However, regulatory mechanisms for histone modifying enzymes like Set2 that travel with elongating Pol II remain largely unknown beyond their initial recruitment events. Here, by fusing Set2 to RNA Pol II, we found that the SRI domain can also recognize linker DNA of chromatin, thereby controlling Set2 substrate specificity. We also discovered that an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) of Set2 primarily restricts Set2 activity to transcribed chromatin and fine-tunes several functions of SRI. Finally, we demonstrated that AID mutations caused hyperactive Set2 in vivo and displayed a synthetic interaction with the histone chaperone FACT. Our data suggest that Set2 is intrinsically regulated through multiple mechanisms and emphasize the importance of a precise temporal control of H3K36 methylation during the dynamic transcription elongation process.}

The PIWI family proteins can play a key role, using a piRNA-mediated slicing mechanism to suppress transposon activity posttranscriptionally. In Drosophila melanogaster, Piwi is predominantly localized in the nucleus and has been implicated in heterochromatin formation. Here, we use female germ-line\textendash specific depletion to study Piwi function. This depletion of Piwi leads to infertility and to axis specification defects in the developing egg chambers; correspondingly, widespread loss of transposon silencing is observed. Germ-line Piwi does not appear to be required for piRNA production. Instead, Piwi requires Aubergine (and presumably secondary piRNA) for proper localization. A subset of transposons that show significant overexpression in germ-line Piwi-depleted ovaries exhibit a corresponding loss of HP1a and H3K9me2. Germ-line HP1a depletion also leads to a loss of transposon silencing, demonstrating the functional requirement for HP1a enrichment at these loci. Considering our results and those of others, we infer that germ-line Piwi functions downstream of piRNA production to promote silencing of some transposons via recruitment of HP1a. Thus, in addition to its better-known function in posttranscriptional silencing, piRNA also appears to function in a targeting mechanism for heterochromatin formation mediated by Piwi.},

Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, vertebrate organisms, express two paralogous GCN5-like acetyltransferases (GCN5 and PCAF), which have been found so far only in SAGA-type complexes referred to hereafter as the STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5/PCAF acetylase) complexes. We now report the purification and characterization of vertebrate (human) ATAC-type complexes and identify novel components of STAGA. We show that human ATAC complexes incorporate in addition to GCN5 or PCAF (GCN5/PCAF), other epigenetic coregulators (ADA2-A, ADA3, STAF36, and WDR5), cofactors of chromatin assembly/remodeling and DNA replication machineries (POLE3/CHRAC17 and POLE4), the stress- and TGF{$\beta$}-activated protein kinase (TAK1/MAP3K7) and MAP3-kinase regulator (MBIP), additional cofactors of unknown function, and a novel YEATS2-NC2{$\beta$} histone fold module that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and negatively regulates transcription when recruited to a promoter. We further identify the p38 kinase-interacting protein (p38IP/FAM48A) as a novel component of STAGA with distant similarity to yeast Spt20. These results suggest that vertebrate ATAC-type and STAGA-type complexes link specific extracellular signals to modification of chromatin structure and regulation of the basal transcription machinery. \textcopyright{} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

We show that LSD1 is required for gastrulation during mouse embryogenesis. Notably, targeted deletion of the gene encoding LSD1 (namely, Aof2) in embryonic stem (ES) cells induces progressive loss of DNA methylation. This loss correlates with a decrease in DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) protein, as a result of reduced Dnmt1 stability. Dnmt1 protein is methylated in vivo, and its methylation is enhanced in the absence of LSD1. Furthermore, Dnmt1 can be methylated by Set7/9 (also known as KMT7) and demethylated by LSD1 in vitro. Our findings suggest that LSD1 demethylates and stabilizes Dnmt1, thus providing a previously unknown mechanistic link between the histone and DNA methylation systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

Here, we show that removing the translational repressor Nanos from either GSCs or their precursors, the primordial germ cells (PGCs), causes both cell types to differentiate into germline cysts. Thus, Nanos is essential for both establishing and maintaining GSCs by preventing their precocious entry into oogenesis. These functions are likely achieved by repressing the translation of differentiation factors in PGCs and GSCs.}

We find that the cardinal function of Argonaute3, whose piRNA guides predominantly correspond to sense transposon sequences, is to produce antisense piRNAs that direct transcriptional silencing by Piwi, rather than to make piRNAs that guide post-transcriptional silencing by Aubergine. We also find that the Tudor domain protein Qin prevents Aubergine's cleavage products from becoming Piwi-bound piRNAs, ensuring that antisense piRNAs guide Piwi. Although Argonaute3 slicing is required to efficiently trigger phased piRNA production, an alternative, slicing-independent pathway suffices to generate Piwi-bound piRNAs that repress transcription of a subset of transposon families. This alternative pathway may help flies silence newly acquired transposons for which they lack extensively complementary piRNAs.},

Little is known, however, about the functional impact of such changes on actual expression levels or about the selective pressures that affect them. Here, we address this question in the context of the evolution of the regulation of RP gene expression by using a comparative genomics approach together with cross-species functional assays. We show that an activator (Ifh1) and a repressor (Crf1) that control RP gene regulation in normal and stress conditions in S. cerevisiae are derived from the duplication and subsequent specialization of a single ancestral protein. We provide evidence that this regulatory innovation coincides with the duplication of RP genes in a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event and may have been important for tighter control of higher levels of RP transcripts. We find that subsequent loss of the derived repressor led to the loss of a stress-dependent repression of RPs in the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. Our comparative computational and experimental approach shows how gene duplication can constrain and drive regulatory evolution and provides a general strategy for reconstructing the evolutionary trajectory of gene regulation across species.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is initiated from G1 of the cell cycle and is characterized by a pre-meiotic S phase followed by two successive nuclear divisions. The first of these, meiosis I, differs from mitosis in having a reductional pattern of chromosome segregation1,2. Here we show that meiosis can be initiated from G2 in fission yeast cells by ectopically activating the meiosis-inducing network. The subsequent meiosis I occurs without a pre-meiotic S phase and with decreased recombination, and exhibits a mitotic pattern of equational chromosome segregation. The subsequent meiosis II results in random chromosome segregation. This behaviour is similar to that observed in cells lacking the meiotic cohesin Rec8 (refs 3, 4), which becomes associated with chromosomes at G1/S phase, including the inner centromere, a region that is probably critical for sister-centromere orientation5. If the expression of Rec8 is delayed to S phase/G2, then the centromeres behave equationally. We propose that the presence of Rec8 in chromatin is required at the pre-meiotic S phase to construct centromeres that behave reductionally and chromosome arms capable of a high level of recombination, and that this explains why meiosis is initiated from G1 of the cell cycle.}

These two properties of heterochromatin have been elucidated from the study of chromosome rearrangements that induce position effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila melanogaster. Novel euchromatin-heterochromatin junctions can affect the expression of euchromatic and heterochromatic genes located several megabases away, distinguishing higher order chromatin structure from most other regulatory mechanisms. Studies of PEV promise insights into the basis for heterochromatin formation and the role of higher order chromatin and chromosome structure in gene regulation. We evaluate the models and experimental data that address the mechanisms of PEV in different cell types, the potential functions of modifiers of PEV, and the relationship of PEV to other phenomena associated with variegated gene expression in Drosophila.},

Genetic analysis of both null and hypomorphic gbb alleles indicates that the gene is required in many developmental processes, including embryonic midgut morphogenesis, patterning of the larval cuticle, fat body morphology, and development and patterning of the imaginal discs. In the embryonic midgut, we show that gbb is required for the formation of the anterior constriction and for maintenance of the homeotic gene Antennapedia in the visceral mesoderm. In addition, we show a requirement for gbb in the anterior and posterior cells of the underlying endoderm and in the formation and extension of the gastric caecae. gbb is required in all the imaginal discs for proper disc growth and for specification of veins in the wing and of macrochaete in the notum. Significantly, some of these tissues have been shown to also require the Drosophila BMP2/4 homolog decapentaplegic (dpp), while others do not.

Meiotically incompetent oocytes were distinguished from their competent counterparts in displaying elaborate interphase-like arrays of cytoplasmic microtubules and dispersed germinal vesicle chromatin. Meiotically competent oocytes were larger in size, exhibited condensation of chromatin around the nucleolus, and displayed a progressive diminution of cytoplasmic microtubules in conjunction with the appearance of multiple microtubule organizing centers. After 24 hr in culture, medium- to large-sized oocytes exhibiting perinucleolar chromatin condensation resume meiosis whereas smaller meiotically incompetent oocytes retain GVs with diffuse chromatin. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence studies using the M-phase phosphoprotein specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2 indicate that the appearance of reactive cytoplasmic foci is directly correlated with nuclear changes characteristic of meiotically competent oocytes. Thus, the earliest transition to a meiotically competent state during oocyte growth in the immature mouse ovary is characterized by stage-specific and coordinated modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. \textcopyright{} 1991.}

Herein, we describe the first genetic analysis of murine VRK1. Two lines of mice containing distinct gene-trap integrations into the Vrk1 locus were established. Insertion into intron 12 (GT12) spared VRK1 function, enabling the examination of VRK1 expression in situ. Insertion into intron 3 (GT3) disrupted VRK1 function, but incomplete splicing to the gene trap rendered this allele hypomorphic (approximately 15\% of wild-type levels of VRK1 remain). GT3/GT3 mice are viable, but both males and females are infertile. In testes, VRK1 is expressed in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia. The infertility of GT3/GT3 male mice results from a progressive defect in spermatogonial proliferation or differentiation, culminating in the absence of mitotic and meiotic cells in adult testis. These data demonstrate an important role for VRK1 in cell proliferation and confirm that the need for VRK1 during gametogenesis is evolutionarily conserved.}

The Drosophila gene was in turn used to construct fusions between S3 and glutathione S-transferase that were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified on affinity columns, and subsequently used for antibody production and biochemical analysis. Antibody specific for S3 was originally tested to determine the subcellular location of S3 by Western (immunoblot) analysis. As expected, the S3 antigen was found associated with purified preparations of ribosomes, but notably the protein was also observed in the nucleus where it was found to be tightly associated with the nuclear matrix. This result, combined with the fact that S3 contains a nuclear localization signal and that the protein shares some homology to a yeast nuclease gene, suggested that S3 might possibly have a role in DNA metabolism. Tests were initially performed to see if S3 contained DNase activity, where it was subsequently determined that the protein specifically cleaved DNA containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic site via a {$\beta$}-elimination reaction. The DNase activity was inactivated by antibody to S3, indicating that the apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity was associated with the Drosophila S3 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that S3 is among a growing class of multifunctional proteins with roles in transcription/translation and DNA repair.}

Emerin has a LEM-domain and therefore binds barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a conserved chromatin protein essential for cell division. BAF recruits emerin to chromatin and regulates higher-order chromatin structure during nuclear assembly. Emerin also binds filaments formed by A-type lamins, mutations in which also cause EDMD. Other partners for emerin include nesprin-1{$\alpha$} and transcriptional regulators such as germ cell-less (GCL). The binding affinities of these partners range from 4 nM (nesprin-1{$\alpha$}) to 200 nM (BAF), and are physiologically significant. Biochemical studies therefore provide a valid means to predict the properties of emerin-lamin complexes in vivo. Emerin and lamin A together form stable complexes with either BAF or GCL in vitro. BAF, however, competes with GCL for binding to emerin in vitro. These and additional partners, notably actin and nuclear myosin I, suggest disease-relevant roles for emerin in gene regulation and the mechanical integrity of the nucleus.

Like dpp, Medea is essential for embryonic dorsal/ventral patterning. However, Mad is essential in the germline for oogenesis whereas Medea is dispensable. In the wing primordium, loss of Medea most severely affects regions receiving low DPP signal. MEDEA is localized in the cytoplasm, is not regulated by phosphorylation, and requires physical association with MAD for nuclear translocation. Furthermore, inactivating MEDEA mutations prevent nuclear translocation either by preventing interaction with MAD or by trapping MAD/MEDEA complexes in the cytosol. Thus MAD-mediated nuclear translocation is essential for MEDEA function. Together these data show that, while MAD is essential for mediating all DPP signals, heteromeric MAD/MEDEA complexes function to modify or enhance DPP responses. We propose that this provides a general model for Smad4/MEDEA function in signaling by the TGF-{$\beta$} family.},

Yet, the sexes have evolved to differ in a multitude of behavioral, morphological, and physiological traits. How did this sexual dimorphism evolve despite the presence of a common underlying genome? We investigated the potential role of gene duplication in the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Because duplication events provide extra genetic material, the sexes each might use this redundancy to facilitate sex-specific gene expression, permitting the evolution of dimorphism. We investigated this hypothesis at the genome-wide level in Drosophila melanogaster, using the presence of sex-biased expression as a proxy for the sex-specific specialization of gene function. We expected that if sexually antagonistic selection is a potent force acting upon individual genes, duplication will result in paralog families whose members differ in sex-biased expression. Gene members of the same duplicate family can have different expression patterns in males versus females. In particular, duplicate pairs containing a male-biased gene are found more frequently than expected, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, when the singleton ortholog is unbiased, duplication appears to allow one of the paralog copies to acquire male-biased expression. Conversely, female-biased expression is not common among duplicates; fewer duplicate genes are expressed in the female-soma and ovaries than in the male-soma and testes. Expression divergence exists more in older than in younger duplicates pairs, but expression divergence does not correlate with protein sequence divergence. Finally, genomic proximity may have an effect on whether paralogs differ in sex-biased expression. We conclude that the data are consistent with a role of gene duplication in fostering male-biased, but not female-biased, gene expression, thereby aiding the evolution of sexual dimorphism. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).

Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) marks transcription start sites of virtually all active genes. Recently, we reported that the WD40-repeat protein WDR5 is important for global levels of H3K4me3 and control of HOX gene expression. Here we show that a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF), an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, mediates a direct preferential association with H3K4me3 tails. Depletion of H3K4me3 causes partial release of the NURF subunit, BPTF (bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor), from chromatin and defective recruitment of the associated ATPase, SNF2L (also known as ISWI and SMARCA1), to the HOXC8 promoter. Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos mimics WDR5 loss-of-function phenotypes, and compromises spatial control of Hox gene expression. These results strongly suggest that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biological pathway in vivo, and that NURF-mediated ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is directly coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain Hox gene expression patterns during development. We also identify a previously unknown function for the PHD finger as a highly specialized methyl-lysine- binding domain. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.}

  abstract = {In the Drosophila ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained primarily by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands produced by the stromal cells of the niche. This signaling represses GSC differentiation by blocking the transcription of the differentiation factor Bam. Remarkably, bam transcription begins only one cell diameter away from the GSC in the daughter cystoblasts (CBs). How this steep gradient of response to BMP signaling is formed has been unclear. Here, we show that Fused (Fu), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates Hedgehog, functions in concert with the E3 ligase Smurf to regulate ubiquitination and proteolysis of the BMP receptor Thickveins in CBs. This regulation generates a steep gradient of BMP activity between GSCs and CBs, allowing for bam expression on CBs and concomitant differentiation. We observed similar roles for Fu during embryonic development in zebrafish and in human cell culture, implying broad conservation of this mechanism. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.}

With just one exception, the enzymes identified in the methylation of specific lysine residues on histones (histone methyltransferases) belong to the SET family. The high-resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor reveals that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) cofactor by inserting its side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme, connecting the two surfaces. Here we show from the structure and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins, is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and allows us to propose a model for the methylation reaction that accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across the SET family.}

However, how this regulation is encoded in the messenger RNA sequence remains largely unknown. Here we uncover unique RNA regulons embedded in homeobox (Hox) 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) that confer ribosome-mediated control of gene expression. These structured RNA elements, resembling viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), are found in subsets of Hox mRNAs. They facilitate ribosome recruitment and require the ribosomal protein RPL38 for their activity. Despite numerous layers of Hox gene regulation, these IRES elements are essential for converting Hox transcripts into proteins to pattern the mammalian body plan. This specialized mode of IRES-dependent translation is enabled by an additional regulatory element that we term the translation inhibitory element (TIE), which blocks cap-dependent translation of transcripts. Together, these data uncover a new paradigm for ribosome-mediated control of gene expression and organismal development.}

Heterogeneity in ribosome composition resulting from differential expression and post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) diversity and the activity of ribosome-associated factors may generate 'specialized ribosomes' that have a substantial impact on how the genomic template is translated into functional proteins. Moreover, constitutive components of the ribosome may also exert more specialized activities by virtue of their interactions with specific mRNA regulatory elements such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Here we discuss the hypothesis that intrinsic regulation by the ribosome acts to selectively translate subsets of mRNAs harbouring unique cis-regulatory elements, thereby introducing an additional level of regulation in gene expression and the life of an organism. \textcopyright{} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we report that histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2, an H3K36me3 methyltransferase, is a crucial regulator of the mouse oocyte epigenome. Deficiency in Setd2 leads to extensive alterations of the oocyte epigenome, including the loss of H3K36me3, failure in establishing the correct DNA methylome, invasion of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 into former H3K36me3 territories and aberrant acquisition of H3K4me3 at imprinting control regions instead of DNA methylation. Importantly, maternal depletion of SETD2 results in oocyte maturation defects and subsequent one-cell arrest after fertilization. The preimplantation arrest is mainly due to a maternal cytosolic defect, since it can be largely rescued by normal oocyte cytosol. However, chromatin defects, including aberrant imprinting, persist in these embryos, leading to embryonic lethality after implantation. Thus, these data identify SETD2 as a crucial player in establishing the maternal epigenome that in turn controls embryonic development.}

A key factor for male germline sex determination is PHD finger protein 7 (Phf7), a histone reader expressed in the male germline that can trigger sex reversal in female germ cells and is also important for efficient spermatogenesis.

The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the TATA box and the initiator (INR) remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for TATA-less genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that {$\sim$} 76\% of human core promoters lack TATA-like elements, have a high GC content, and are enriched in Sp1-binding sites. We further identify two motifs - M3 (SCGGAAGY) and M22 (TGCGCANK) - that occur preferentially in human TATA-less core promoters. About 24\% of human genes have a TATA-like element and their promoters are generally AT-rich; however, only {$\sim$} 10\% of these TATA-containing promoters have the canonical TATA box (TATAWAWR). In contrast, {$\sim$} 46\% of human core promoters contain the consensus INR (YYANWYY) and {$\sim$} 30\% are INR-containing TATA-less genes. Significantly, {$\sim$} 46\% of human promoters lack both TATA-like and consensus INR elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type INR sequences are present - and tend to cluster - in the transcription start site (TSS) region of {$\sim$} 40\% of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that TATA-less genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic "housekeeping" processes, while TATA-containing genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli. These results reveal unexpected similarities in the occurrence of specific core promoter types and in their associated biological processes in yeast and humans and point to novel vertebrate-specific DNA motifs that might play a selective role in TATA-independent transcription. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We now demonstrate that ultraspiracle (usp), a Drosophila RXR homolog, can substitute for RXR in stimulating the DNA binding of receptors for retinoic acid, T3, vitamin D, and peroxisome proliferator activators. These observations led to the search and ultimate identification of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) as a Drosophila partner of usp. Together, usp and EcR bind DNA in a highly cooperative fashion. Cotransfection of both EcR and usp expression vectors is required to render cultured mammalian cells ecdysone responsive. These results implicate usp as an integral component of the functional EcR. By demonstrating that receptor heterodimer formation precedes the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate lineages, these data underscore a central role for RXR and its homolog usp in the evolution and control of the nuclear receptor-based endocrine system. \textcopyright{} 1992.}

Previous studies indicate that a GC-rich DNA motif is the specific target of the ARID domain. However, the details of the interaction between the ARID domain and duplex DNA require further study. Here, we utilized NMR spectroscopy to assign the backbone amino acids and mapped the DNA-binding sites of the human JARID1B ARID domain. Perturbations to 1H-15N correlation spectra revealed that the flexible loop L1 of ARID was the main DNA-binding interface. EMSA and intrinsic fluorescence experiments demonstrated that mutations on loop L1 strongly reduced the DNA-binding activity of JARID1B ARID. Furthermore, transfection of mutant forms resulted in a distinct loss of intrinsic H3K4 demethylase activity, implying that the flexible loop L1 made a major contribution to sustaining the DNA-binding ability of JARID1B ARID domain. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We have studied the role of RA in mouse limb development by focusing on CYP26B1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that inactivates RA. Cyp26b1 was shown to be expressed in the distal region of the developing limb bud, and mice that lack CYP26B1 exhibited severe limb malformation (meromelia). The lack of CYP26B1 resulted in spreading of the RA signal toward the distal end of the developing limb and induced proximodistal patterning defects characterized by expansion of proximal identity and restriction of distal identity. CYP26B1 deficiency also induced pronounced apoptosis in the developing limb and delayed chondrocyte maturation. Wild-type embryos exposed to excess RA phenocopied the limb defects of Cyp26b1 -/- mice. These observations suggest that RA acts as a morphogen to determine proximodistal identity, and that CYP26B1 prevents apoptosis and promotes chondrocyte maturation, in the developing limb. \textcopyright{} 2004 by Cell Press.}

Here we document a recent evolutionary transition of a gene cluster from euchromatin to heterochromatin, which occurred {$<$}20 million years ago in the drosophilid lineage. This finding reveals evolutionary fluidity between these two genomic compartments and provides a powerful approach to identifying differences between euchromatic and heterochromatic genes. Promoter mapping of orthologous gene pairs led to the discovery of the ``slippery promoter,'' characterized by multiple transcriptional start sites predominately at adenines, as a common promoter type found in both heterochromatic and euchromatic genes of Drosophila. Promoter type is diverse within the gene cluster but largely conserved between heterochromatic and euchromatic genes, eliminating the hypothesis that adaptation to heterochromatin required major alterations in promoter structure. Transition to heterochromatin is consistently associated with gene expansion due to the accumulation of transposable elements and increased A-T content. We conclude that heterochromatin-dependent regulation requires specialized enhancers or higher-order interactions and propose a facilitating role for transposable elements.},

A mutation that alters this residue, which lies in the interface between histone H3/H4 tetramers and H2A/H2B dimers, confers phenotypes consistent with defects in chromatin assembly such as sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and derepression and alteration of silent chromatin structure. In addition, this mutation destabilizes the histone octamer, leading to defects in chromatin structure.

  abstract = {Actin-related proteins are ubiquitous components of chromatin remodelers and are conserved from yeast to man. We have examined the role of the budding yeast actin-related protein Arp6 in gene expression, both as a component of the SWR1 complex (SWR-C) and in its absence. We mapped Arp6 binding sites along four yeast chromosomes using chromatin immunoprecipitation from wild-type and swr1 deleted (swr1{$\Delta$}) cells. We find that a majority of Arp6 binding sites coincide with binding sites of Swr1, the catalytic subunit of SWR-C, and with the histone H2A variant Htz1 (H2A.Z) deposited by SWR-C. However, Arp6 binding detected at centromeres, the promoters of ribosomal protein (RP) genes, and some telomeres is independent of Swr1 and Htz1 deposition. Given that RP genes and telomeres both show association with the nuclear periphery, we monitored the ability of Arp6 to mediate the localization of chromatin to nuclear pores. Arp6 binding is sufficient to shift a randomly positioned locus to nuclear periphery, even in a swr1{$\Delta$} strain. Arp6 is also necessary for the pore association of its targeted RP promoters possibly through cell cycle-dependent factors. Loss of Arp6, but not Htz1, leads to an up-regulation of these RP genes. In contrast, the pore-association of GAL1 correlates with Htz1 deposition, and loss of Arp6 reduces both GAL1 activation and peripheral localization. We conclude that Arp6 functions both together with the nucleosome remodeler Swr1 and also without it, to mediate Htz1-dependent and Htz1-independent binding of chromatin domains to nuclear pores. This association is shown to have modulating effects on gene expression., Actin and the structurally similar actin-related proteins (ARPs) are major components of nucleosome remodeling complexes in the nucleus. Here we show that budding yeast Arp6 has functions independent of its catalytic chromatin remodeling partner, Swr1. Arp6 binds to multiple promoters and subtelomeric zones at which Swr1 does not bind, and this association increases in strains lacking an intact SWR-C remodeling complex. We show that Arp6 can mediate the association of the ribosomal protein gene promoters to which it binds, with the nuclear envelope. The loss of Arp6 led to an up-regulation of these ribosomal protein genes, yet had the opposite effect on the galactose-induced GAL1 promoter, where it binds together with Swr1 and the histone H2A variant H2A.Z. Indeed, loss of Arp6 and nuclear envelope binding delays galactose-induced activation of GAL1. The two opposing functions of Arp6 correlate with different pathways of anchoring mediated by Arp6: one requires that the intact SWR-C deposits H2A.Z, while in the second Arp6 may mediate promoter binding to nuclear pore baskets directly. In both cases, Arp6 is implicated in the spatial localization of chromatin within the interphase nucleus, which has functional consequences on expression. This identifies a novel function for actin-related proteins.},

Accurate quantification of these marks is an ongoing challenge due to the variety of modifications and their wide dynamic range of abundance. Here we present EpiProfile 2.0, an extended version of our 2015 software (v1.0), for accurate quantification of histone peptides based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. EpiProfile 2.0 is now optimized for data-independent acquisition through the use of precursor and fragment extracted ion chromatography to accurately determine the chromatographic profile and to discriminate isobaric forms of peptides. The software uses an intelligent retention time prediction trained on the analyzed samples to enable accurate peak detection. EpiProfile 2.0 supports label-free and isotopic labeling, different organisms, known sequence mutations in diseases, different derivatization strategies, and unusual PTMs (such as acyl-derived modifications). In summary, EpiProfile 2.0 is a universal and accurate platform for the quantification of histone marks via LC-MS/MS. Being the first software of its kind, we anticipate that EpiProfile 2.0 will play a fundamental role in epigenetic studies relevant to biology and translational medicine.

While many somatic stem cells are multipotent, with potentially multiple differentiation pathways, GSCs are unipotent. For these relatively simple characteristics (e.g. constant proliferation and unipotency), GSCs have served as ideal model systems for the study of adult stem cell behavior, leading to many important discoveries.

Thus, maternally inherited H3K27me3, propagated in the early embryo, regulates the activation of enhancers and lineage-specific genes during development.}

  abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis drives cell growth and proliferation, but mechanisms that modulate this process within specific lineages remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a Drosophila RNA polymerase I (Pol I) regulatory complex composed of Under-developed (Udd), TAF1B, and a TAF1C-like factor. Disruption of udd or TAF1B results in reduced ovarian germline stem cell (GSC) proliferation. Female GSCs display high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, and Udd becomes enriched in GSCs relative to their differentiating daughters. Increasing Pol I transcription delays differentiation, whereas reducing rRNA production induces both morphological changes that accompany multicellular cyst formation and specific decreased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway component Mad. These findings demonstrate that modulating rRNA synthesis fosters changes in the cell fate, growth, and proliferation of female Drosophila GSCs and their daughters.},

  abstract = {Most ribosomal proteins (RP) are regarded as essential, static components that contribute only to ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. However, emerging evidence suggests that RNA-binding RP are dynamic and can influence cellular processes by performing ``extraribosomal,'' regulatory functions involving binding to select critical target mRNAs. We report here that the RP, Rpl22, and its highly homologous paralog Rpl22-Like1 (Rpl22l1 or Like1) play critical, extraribosomal roles in embryogenesis. Indeed, they antagonistically control morphogenesis through developmentally regulated localization to the nucleus, where they modulate splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding smad2, an essential transcriptional effector of Nodal/TGF-{$\beta$} signaling. During gastrulation, Rpl22 binds to intronic sequences of smad2 pre-mRNA and induces exon 9 skipping in cooperation with hnRNP-A1. This action is opposed by its paralog, Like1, which promotes exon 9 inclusion in the mature transcript. The nuclear roles of these RP in controlling morphogenesis represent a fundamentally different and paradigm-shifting mode of action for RP.},

We report the structure of a ternary complex including DIM-5, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, and a substrate H3 peptide. The histone tail inserts as a parallel strand between two DIM-5 strands, completing a hybrid sheet. Three post-SET cysteines coordinate a zinc atom together with Cys242 from the SET signature motif (NHXCXPN) near the active site. Consequently, a narrow channel is formed to accommodate the target Lys9 side chain. The sulfur atom of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, where the transferable methyl group is to be attached in S-adenosyl-L-methionine, lies at the opposite end of the channel, {$\sim$}4 \textbackslash AA away from the target Lys9 nitrogen. Structural comparison of the active sites of DIM-5, an H3 Lys9 trimethyltransferase, and SET7/9, an H3 Lys4 monomethyltransferase, allowed us to design substitutions in both enzymes that profoundly alter their product specificities without affecting their catalytic activities.},

Prior work suggested that dynein pulls the nucleus to the anterior side along a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, but this mechanism has not been tested. By imaging live oocytes, we find that the nucleus migrates with a posterior indentation that correlates with its direction of movement. Furthermore, both nuclear movement and the indentation depend on microtubule polymerization from centrosomes behind the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus is not pulled to the anterior but is pushed by the force exerted by growing microtubules. Nuclear migration and DV axis formation therefore depend on centrosome positioning early in oogenesis and are independent of anterior-posterior axis formation.}

Many of these PTMs are selectively recognized by dedicated effector proteins for normal cell growth and development, while dysregulation of these recognition events is often implicated in human diseases, notably cancer. Thus, it is fundamentally important to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the readout of PTMs on histones. The Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, Sas5 (YEATS) domain is an emerging reader module that selectively recognizes histone lysine acylation with a preference for crotonylation over acetylation. In the review, we discuss the recognition of histone acylations by the YEATS domain and the biological significance of this readout from multiple perspectives.},

To investigate the in vivo function of JARID1B, we developed Jarid1b-/- mice and characterized their phenotypes in detail. Unlike previously reported Jarid1b-/- strains, the majority of these Jarid1b-/- mice were viable beyond embryonic and neonatal stages. This allowed us to further examine phenotypes associated with the loss of JARID1B in pubertal development and pregnancy. These Jarid1b-/- mice exhibited decreased body weight, premature mortality, decreased female fertility, and delayed mammary gland development. Related to these phenotypes, JARID1B loss decreased serum estrogen level and reduced mammary epithelial cell proliferation in early puberty. In mammary epithelial cells, JARID1B loss diminished the expression of key regulators for mammary morphogenesis and luminal lineage specification, including FOXA1 and estrogen receptor {$\alpha$}. Mechanistically, JARID1B was required for GATA3 recruitment to the Foxa1 promoter to activate Foxa1 expression. These results indicate that JARID1B positively regulates mammary ductal development through both extrinsic and cell-autonomous mechanisms. \textcopyright{} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},
